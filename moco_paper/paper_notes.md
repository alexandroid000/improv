Other PL/interface?

Make image/video demo and email/tweet live coders to get feedback

- process of making pattern, then put brackets on


Mattox Meeting
--------------

-   write example programs that we want - then figure out what primitives we
    need


Major TODOs:
------------

-   implement reflect
-   try it out in Gazebo
-   multi-robot control ("b1" -> "r1")
-   interactions with other robots (do si do)
-   need to be able to publish to multiple robots
-   need to be able to subscribe to current xy location and orientation

Intro
-----

"Live coders expose and rewire the innards of software while it generates
improvised music and/or visuals."

Semantics
---------

-   parallel and series composition
-   multi-robot control
-   what needs to be specified about the robot

Combinators
-----------

-   reverse, retrograde
-   reflect
-   "follow"??
-   random noise / distortion

Extensions
----------

-   Integrate with ECLs?

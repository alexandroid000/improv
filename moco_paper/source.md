"I think it's important to consider programming as exploration rather than
implementation, because then we are using computer languages more like human
languages. Any software interface can be thought of as a language, but the
openness of programming allows us to set our own creative limits to explore,
instead of working inside fixed, pre-defined limits. To me this is using
computers on a deep level for what they are - language machines." -- Alex

\abstract{
We introduce a new software tool, Improv, for high-level description of
robotic motion, along with immediate simulation of the resulting movement
("live-coding" for robots).

The system is composed of a domain-specific language, which compiles to
instructions in a
Haskell client library for ROS, the "Robot Operating System," which controls the
robot, either in simulation or reality.

ROS is an open-source robot software framework which is widely used in
academia and industry, and is supported by many commercially available robots.

The compilation step is performed whenever the user saves changes to their program
file, creating a "live-coding" interface which works with any text editor and
provides immediate visual feedback in the robot simulator.

The domain-specific language is inspired by
abstractions from choreographic terminology. It allows for several ways of
composing and transforming movement primitives, such as reversing movements in
space and time, and changing the relative timing of movements.

Currently, *Improv* can be used to control any robot which uses the `Twist`
message type in ROS, and has been tested with TurtleBot robots in the Gazebo
simulation engine.

We hope this tool will be of interest to people looking for an accessible way to
generate robot motion, such as educators, artists, and researchers.

Introduction
---------------

Within the robotics community, using ROS and its integrated simulators can be
notoriously tricky. While a very powerful and widely-used tool, ROS requires
users to specify motion commands at a relatively low level of abstraction,
usually in Python or C++. Inspired by a few existing tools, such as *Dance*, a
functional programming language inspired by Labanotation and augmented with a
reactive layer which allows event-based control [@Dance2003], *roshask*, a ROS
client library written in Haskell [@cowley2011stream], and *TidalCycles*, a
language for live-coding electronic music [@mclean2010tidal], we imagine a tool
where users can write code that is nearer to human language descriptions of
robot motion, and immediately see the results of their code in a simulator. This
would allow for faster development cycles, less frustration on the part of the
user, and would generally make robotics programming more accessible to people
not trained in robotics or computer science. This paper outlines the first steps
that have been taken toward this tool, as well as an overview of related work.

### LBMS Framework


Over the last century, the Laban Bartenieff Movement System (LBMS) has been
developed by a community of movement researchers, led by Rudolf Laban, Irmgard
Bartenieff, and Ann Hutchinson Guest. Labanotation has been developed as a
movement notation system, used for precisely describing motion 
in time and space. The notation is specialized for human bodies, with
symbols for specific body parts. Labanotation is used for a detailed,
reproducible record of movement, somewhat similar to how sheet music can be used
to reproduce a piece of music.

*Motif* is a reconception of Labanotation that shares many symbols and concepts,
but denotes the most important elements of a dance without quite the same level
of detail. In Motif, units of movement are combined into phrases. The phrasing
or grouping of movement is important for expression: "two people might have the
same Effort elements present, or the same body parts utilized, but if they have
organized and combined the elements differently the message will be dissimilar"
[@hackney2003making]. The LBMS paradigm also offers a categorization which is
useful for movement analysis: Body, Effort, Shape, and Space. These terms will
be capitalized through this document to differentiate them from the colloquial
terms.

### Adapting formalisms from LBMS to Computer Languages

As it was developed before computers were widespread, and encompasses many
concepts that we do not know how to represent in code, Labanotation and Motif
cannot be directly translated into executable specifications. Instead, in this
project I have aimed to take inspiration from, and use some of the formalisms developed by
the dance and movement analysis community, leveraging their expertise. At the
same time, we need to change some of the mechanical aspects of the notation to
improve the expressivity and compactness of representations in the language
being developed.

For example, one of the most basic programming tools - iterating an instruction
a certain number of times - has an interesting representation in dance notation.
In Ann Hutchinson Guest's book *Labanotation*, she details the expressive
capabilities of the language with regards to repetition of motion. Measures may
be repeated exactly or symmetrically across different body planes, they may be
repeated with small differences noted, and they may be repeated an arbitrary
number of times [@labanotation]. There are also abbreviations for exact repeats
or "similar" repeats.

There is a notation for labelling a section of the score with a letter,
and then later referencing that letter along with a repeat symbol to indicate
which movement should be repeated. If there is no letter given, it is assumed
that the most recent phrase is the one that should be repeated.

Modern programming practice has developed more compact and consistent
representations of these concepts. However, the taxonomies and formalisms
developed by the movement observation and analysis communities have proven to be
very helpful in this project. The relevant concepts will be explored more in
Section [5](#improv).

### Lifeforms

*Lifeforms* is a software system developed largely by Thecla Schiphorst and
Thomas Calvert at Simon Fraser University, and
used by the choreographer Merce Cunningham from 1989 onward. It has been under
development since 1986 and is still commercially available. In the version
described in her 1993 thesis, the software has three modes: a *movement
sequence* editor, where the user can design small phrases or movement motifs on
 a single body; a *spatial sequence* editor, which allows the user to arrange
groups of dancers in space; and a *timeline* editor, which allows rearrangement
and transformation of sequences in time.

Users can design movement sequences in several ways - one way is that the user
specifies *keyframes* - specific poses of a simulated human body - and the
program generates smooth movements between the frames. Users can also click and
drag parts of the body, with reactions calculated with inverse kinematics.
Lifeforms can use skeletons other than the human body, but as it is specialized
for dance choreography applications, it has a large library of predefined
movement sequences, such as movements from ballet and modern dance.

Schiphorst's thesis [@schiphorst] contains a detailed history of
computer-assisted choreographic tools, starting in 1964 with a program developed
at the University of Pittsburgh which generated random dance sequences. There
has been a long history of using computer systems to record, interpret and
generate notation and choreographic scores for dance, often based on
Labanotation. As early as 1979, the importance of abstraction was recognized. A
software tool developed at Simon Fraser University was perhaps the first
exploration into parameterized abstractions for movement specifications: "the
instruction sequence is not modified, but the important features, such as the
direction the dancer is facing while performing the sequence, as well as the
speed and the style, can be made parameters of the macro" [@Calvert79]. The
goals of *Improv* are not much different, though the software and visualization
tools I have access to are nearly four decades further along.

These
projects, and many that have followed, have been constrained by the available
technology - programming languages with low-level instructions and unintuitive
syntax, and graphical displays that are slow to update and without good physics
simulators. These problems still plague tools for movement designers, including
the tool described in this paper. But as Schiphorst argues, "it is not
technological constraints that hold us back from using technology in new ways;
technology changes at a tremendous rate. Our willingness to explore beyond the
constraints of our imagination has the greatest effect" [@schiphorst].

### Dance

*Dance* is a domain-specific language built in Haskell, a strongly-typed
functional programming language [@Dance2003]. *Dance* was developed at Yale in
2003 by Liwen Huang and Paul Hudak. The project included a base DSL inspired by
Labanotation, as well as a reactive layer that allowed the robot to react to
sensor events. The project targeted humanoid robots, while *Improv* has so far
targeted mobile robots, and *Dance* code would generate the necessary 3D
simulation code, though did not include the fast-feedback live-coding interface
of this work and predates ROS. *Improv* has incorporated and adapted some of the
data structures from *Dance*, namely the `Action` and `Dance` data types.

### Automatic Phrase Generation

Another paradigm for automatically generating (or synthesizing) movement
patterns is to specify a transition system, usually as an automata, which may
include logic-based specifications on allowed transitions. 

In [@laviers2011automatic], a movement description and generating framework is
proposed. The method requires a transition system - a labelled NFA where states
are poses, and transitions provide a way to move the robot between poses - as
well as an LTL specification of requirements such as "never lift one leg up
while the other is already raised," or "always eventually return to pose 3." The
LTL specification is converted into a BÃ¼chi automaton, and the product automaton
with the transition system is formed.

The resulting automaton will only accept and generate phrases that are
consistent with both the physical dynamics and the high-level specifications.

The limitations of the expressivity of this system are bounded by the
expressivity of the transition system - which is platform-specific - and LTL.

Overall, the use of formal logics or automatic movement generation are outside
the scope of this project - we are focused more on programming language design
for accessibility and ease of use. However, we may dream of a language which is
easy to use *and* allows formal guarantees on movement properties (for
example, that movement will be safe, or have a certain style).


### compositional motion descriptions

Many specification languages for robotic motion exist, such as MDLe

FRP

MDLe is a motion description language with atoms of the form $(u, \xi)$, where
$u$ is a *control quark*, a control input which is a function of time and sensor
readings, and $\xi$ is a boolean function over the sensor readings which
indicates when to end the current atom and move to the next (similar to mode
switches in hybrid automata).

Instead of being composed in a multidigraph, atoms are composed
through *encapsulation* and *string concatenation*. Encapsulation means that an
interrupt $\xi$ can apply to an entire string, not just one control quark.
Concatenation means that once the first string in the concatenation is
interrupted, the next string begins.


### Modular, Compositional Actions

When considering how to compose movements, a natural scheme arises - movements
can happen in series, one after the other, or they may happen in parallel,
either with two actions occuring with two different parts of a body or by two
disconnected bodies moving at the same time.

Series-parallel digraphs have been long known in computer science, but only
recently applied to robotic motion languages, such as in [@hadas]. The language
developed has two composition operators, that allow behaviors to be executed in
series or in parallel. The language was designed for a modular, composable robot
hardware platform, so when designs are physically composed, their behaviors can
be composed as well as behaviors for the larger design. Using this language, the
researchers were able to create "driving" and "turning" behaviors for a
28-degree-of-freedom backhoe by composing behaviors for smaller "car" designs
(see Figure \ref{compose} for an example of a large robot design with modular
actions).


### Algorave


![In algoraves, performers often project code while using it to compose live
music.](/home/alli/common/figs/algorave.jpg){width=8cm}

*Algorave* is a performance movement where "Using systems built for
creating algorithmic music and visuals... musicians are able to compose and
work live with their music as algorithms." [^2] Specifically, I have focused on
analyzing *TidalCycles*, a Haskell-based DSL for composing electronic music.
Code written in this DSL looks like:


```haskell

d1 $ sound "bd*4" # gain "0.5" # delay "0.5"

d2 $ sound "bd*4" # gain (every 3 (rev) $ "1 0.8 0.5 0.7")

```

where the two lines of code, when executed, play simultaneously. Music samples -
such as "bd", bass drum - are imported and transformed with gains, delays, and
patterns. In the second line, a pattern of gain transformations is applied, and
every third time this pattern is applied, it is reversed.

[^2]: \url{https://algorave.com/about/}

### Other computer art

Algebraically, we say that we use the *free monoid* over directions to avoid
losing any information in the composition process. For an interesting discussion
of the usefulness of monoids in library design, see [@monoids].

### Influences on Improv

The algorave community values tools which allow the user maximum freedom, to
encourage creativity, but at the same time are trying to make their tools
accessible to artists and people without much coding experience. These goals are
shared by my project.

Many of the design decisions of *Improv* and *TidalCycles* are similar - how to
most effectively use Haskell? How to manage timing of events, and what should be
the semantics of composing events in parallel and series?

The algorave community also has a heavy emphasis on live-coding, or coding in
front of people as part of a performance. This requires tools which have low
latency between writing code and producing music. Similarly, I want to
accomplish "on the fly" robotics programming, where users can get immediate
feedback - visually, through a simulator - while they are writing code.


4. Evaluating Design Languages
===========================

Cognitive Dimensions
--------------------

When discussing design principles for user interfaces and programming
languages, the framework developed by Green and Petre - the *cognitive
dimensions of notations* - can be quite useful [@green1996usability]. There are
fourteen "cognitive dimensions," or criteria for evaluating programming
languages. In particular, the following have been ones I focused on while
developing this project:

-   *Progressive Evaluation:* Can a partially-complete program be executed to
    obtain feedback on 'How am I doing'?
-   *Viscosity:* How much effort is required to perform a single change?
-   *Closeness of mapping*: What 'programming games' need to be learned?
-   *Consistency:* When some of the language has been learnt, how much of the
    rest can be inferred?
-   *Error-proneness:* Does the design of the notation induce 'careless
    mistakes'?

5. Improv
======

One main contribution of this project is the development of a domain specific
language (DSL), embedded in the programming language Haskell, which allows the
specification of different robotic platforms and motion sequences on those
platforms. This DSL is integrated with the software platform ROS (robot
operating system), a commonly used open-source tool for modelling and
controlling robotic systems. Thus, instructions written in the DSL are 
converted into *ROS messages*, which are passed to a simulator to
enable immediate feedback about the execution of the motion instruction on a
given robotic platform. The necessary plumbing tools have been constructed to
make Improv is a live-coding tool for the creative design of robot motion. See
Figure \ref{flowchart} for an overflow of the dataflow of *Improv*.

All code referenced in this section of the paper is available at the author's
github [^1].

Haskell syntax notes: `[Thing]` indicates a list of `Thing`s. Data structures are
constructed as:

```haskell
data Blah a = Foo a
            | Bar
```

indicating that the type `Blah` is parameterized over another type `a`, and
consists either of types `Foo a` or types `Bar`.

Language Design
---------------


### Grammar of Improv DSL

```haskell

exp = exp exp
exp = exp || exp
exp = [exp]
exp = (exp)
exp = transformer exp
exp = prim

```

Where `transformer` is one of `repeat`, `reflect`, `reverse`, or `retrograde`.

Motion primitives (`prim`) currently available are `left`, `right`, `forward` and
`backward`. Note that `reverse left` is semantically equivalent to `right`, and
similarly for the other directions, but all primitives are provided for ease of
use.

### Motion Composition

In this section, we will overview some of the syntax and semantics of the DSL,
and explain some of the different composition operators.

We take some inspiration from the formalisms developed by LBMS - for example,
using directions defined relative to a kinesphere centered at a origin on the
body. We define origins by their unique integer ID. We also allow five different
`Length`s or Spatial extents.

Natural `Direction`s such as left, right, forward, etc are defined and we
introduce a composition operator, `:*:`, of the directions. Right now, there are
no reductions done over this composition operator until the robot-specific
compilation step - this leaves maximum flexibility in how to interpret
compositions of directions. In LBMS, there are 27 possible directions, 9 at each
level. However, we may imagine a robot with fine motor control that is able to
interpret a composition of three `Lef`s and one `Forward` as a weighted average
of vector representations of those directions, instead of binning this
instruction as `Forward-Left`.


```haskell

data Direction = Lef | Righ | Forward
               | Backward | Center
               | Low | Mid | High
               | Direction :*: Direction


data Length = Zero | Quarter | Half | ThreeFourths | Full

data Origin = O Int -- unique id for each origin

```

The next important data structure is `Action`s, which can either be a single
action - defined by an origin, direction, and spatial extent, or a list of
actions (to be performed sequentially). I plan to refactor this data type to be
independent of `Origin` - it makes more sense to me to specify the `Origin` and
body part involved in the motion together, at a later stage, and leave `Action`s
independent of the robot body.

I also think I am going to remove lists of actions from the definition, and have
sequential composition only at the `Dance` level.

```haskell

data Action = A Origin Direction Length
            | As [Action]
            
data Dance b = Prim Action b
             | Rest
             | Dance b :+: Dance b -- in series
             | Dance b :||: Dance b -- in parallel
            
```

The `Dance` datatype is heavily inspired by the *Dance* library described
earlier. This data type is parameterized over the type of robot body, which
could be a kinematic chain or some other type. `Dance`s can be `Action`s paired
with body parts, a `Rest`, or series or parallel compositions. Here it is
important to note the difference between sequential movements defined by the
`:+:` operator, and sequential movements defined by a list of `Dance`s.
Similarly to the semantics of *TidalCycles*, a list of `Dance`s will compile
down to a sequence of motions where each element in the list is performed in the
same amount of time (a "beat"). A series composition *inside* one of those
elements implies that each of those motions will be "sped up" to fit within the
same beat.

Consider the example:

```haskell

danceLeft = Prim (A 0 Left Full) arm1
center = Prim (A 0 Center Zero) arm1
danceRight = Prim (A 0 Right Full) arm2

dance = [danceLeft, Rest, center, danceRight :+: danceLeft]

```

In this example, `danceLeft` is a primitive that extends `arm1` fully to the
`Left`. `danceRight` does the same with a different arm to the `Right`. `center`
brings `arm1` back to the center. The function `dance`, which has type `[Dance
b]`, specifies a dance where `arm1` is extended left for one beat, the whole
robot rests for one beat, the arm returns to center for one beat, and then
`arm2` is extended to the right in half a beat after which `arm1` extends to the
left for the remaining half a beat. This requires the robot to move twice as
fast, placing physical limitations on how many actions can be performed in one
beat. These limits are not described by the language - we allow the user to
discover them through experimentation.

The final important data type to discuss is the description of robots
themselves. So far, I have implemented a kinematic chain data type, which has
the usual tree structure, except I allow more than two chains to be connected by
a single joint. Also, I allow "forests" of disconnected kinematic trees.

I also define a type class `Parts` which requires the functionality `contains`,
which takes a body part and returns all its sub-parts (parts moved if the input
part is moved). It also requires a function `origin` which returns a default
`Origin` for each body part.

```haskell

data KineChain a = Joint Origin [KineChains a]
                 | Link Origin a
                 | Collection [KineChains a]

class Parts b where
    contains :: b -> [b]
    origin :: b -> Origin
    
```

Often, robots and motion patterns have many natural symmetries that can be
useful for compactly representing specifications and instructions. Often in
dance classes, dancers will learn a routine on one "side" and then be instructed
to perform it on the "other side". Haskell type classes provide a way to make a
general abstraction of symmetry that can be applied to any data type, whether
that type is `Direction`s, `Action`s, robot body data types, etc. To be an
instance of the `Symmetric` class, data type `a` must have a function defined
for it that takes a `Plane` (cartesian or body-centric), and computes the
reflection of type `a` over that plane. 

```haskell

class Symmetric a where
    refl :: Plane -> a -> a
    
instance Symmetric Direction where
    refl plane (dir1 :*: dir2) = (refl plane dir1) :*: (refl plane dir2)
    refl YZ Lef = Righ
    refl YZ Righ = Lef
    etc
```

### Timing

Some robot motion description languages, such as MDL [@mdle] or hybrid automata
[@hybrid], require "triggers" which signal when to end a specific action. These
triggers can take the form of explicit timers or can be conditional sensor-driven
events. However, natural language description of movement often use only
implicit timing commands: for example, "step forward, turn right, and do that
again twice as fast." Thus, to minimize the amount of low-level details that
must be specified by the user, we adopt the idea from TidalCycles of a global
"cycle" or beat. In TidalCycles, the default cycle plays at 1 Hz (one cycle per
second). You can compress multiple samples or patterns inside of one cycle, or
stretch one pattern over multiple cycles, but everything is specified relative
to the global clock.

In Improv, this global clock is governed by the rate at which our node publishes
messages to ROS. In the current implementation, we are sending velocity commands
to the simulator, so if we publish a command to "move forward at 1 meter/second"
at 1 Hz, we will not be able to specify movements which only translate the robot
by 0.5 meters. The only way to accomplish this would be to tell the robot to
travel half as fast for the same amount of time, which would not necessarily be
the desired movement.

To solve this problem, I am proposing to allow the user to vary the global
publishing rate as a parameter in their robot configuration file. This serves
essentially as the "movement resolution" - the fastest rate at which we can
switch between movement primitives.

For example, say the user sets the global publishing rate to be 100Hz. Then we
are faced with the question, how long should a single movement primitive - say,
"turn core left 90 degrees" - take? The user will be able to speed up and slow
down movements - by composing them in series or in parallel with other movements
or rests - but it seems that we should have a "default" duration of movement.
This duration should be invariant of the global publishing rate, which the user
may change according to their resolution needs.

This is an area where I have not yet worked out the desired semantics and how to
implement them. This is the area of the project under most active development
currently.
 


`Dance` Transformations
-----------------------

Using features of Haskell such as higher-order functions and pattern matching,
we can implement functions to transform sequences of motions. For example, we
can take a list of `Dance`s and combine them sequentially or in parallel:

```haskell

seqL, parL :: (Parts a) => [Dance a] -> Dance a
seqL = foldr (:+:) (Rest 0)
parL = foldr (:||:) (Rest 0)

```

We can also take a single `Dance` and repeat it `n` times in sequence:

```haskell

repeatn :: (Parts a) => Int -> Dance a -> Dance a
repeatn n dance = seqL $ take n $ repeat dance

```

And given a function that transforms `Action`s (say, one which composes all the
directions with `High`, "lifting" them), we can apply this function to all
primitives in a `Dance`:

```haskell

-- map over all actions in a dance
transform :: (Parts a) => (Action -> Action) -> Dance a -> Dance a
transform f (x :+: y) = (transform f x) :+: (transform f y)
transform f (x :||: y) = (transform f x) :||: (transform f y)
transform f (Rest) = Rest
transform f (Prim act dur) = Prim (f act) dur

```

Many more transformation are possible, and in particular the LBMS framework can
be used to inspire transformations. We can imagine transformations which change
the dynamic qualities of a movement, such as its Effort quality or expanding
or contracting it in Space.

Editor-agnostic live-coding
---------------------------

One challenge that commonly ails interactive text-based tools is being 
tied to a specific editor. For example, the algorave live-coding tool TidalCycles
was originally developed for emacs, a powerful editor which has a notoriously
steep learning curve. Many people prefer to use simpler editors, so new
live-coding plug-ins have been developed for editors such as Atom and Sublime
Text. The downside is that for every new editor that people want to use,
significant programming and interfacing effort must be expended.

Often, developers of new programming languages and software tools have the time
and motivation to learn how to use complex text editors, but the desired user
base may not. In our case, we are developing a tool that should be usable by
artists, children, and programming novices, as well as experienced roboticists.
Thus, we wish to allow users flexibility to choose their editor, so they may use
more intuitive and graphical editors such as Sublime text or more specialized
editors such as vim.

To accomplish this, instead of creating a plugin interface for each desired
editor, we run a shell script which simply monitors the file that the user is
editing for changes. Every time the user saves the file, the program detects a
change, compiles the program to a ROS node, resets the simulator, and restarts
the ROS node. This design choice circumvents the need to interface with specific
editors.

ROS interface (roshask)
-------------

*Roshask* is a client library for ROS, written in Haskell. It was developed by
Anthony Cowley at the University of Pennsylvania GRASP Lab [@cowley2011stream].
It is capable of hooking into a ROS server and publishing to and subscribing
from topics. It treats topics as first class entities, which allows for topic
*combinators*, such as an `everyNew` function which takes two topics as
arguments and publishes a tuple with a message from each every time *either* of
them publishes a new messages. Likewise, it has a `bothNew` function which takes
two topics and publishes a tuple with their data only when *both* topics have
new messages. This infrastructure makes it much easier to reason about timing of
events in a ROS system with topics which publish at different rates (such as
sensors with different update frequencies). The types of topic combinators that
can be created are limited only by our imagination.

*Roshask* treats topics as *streams* - infinite sequences of events, processed
one at a time. Haskell has natural data structures for handling streams, such as
lists and monads, and uses *lazy evaluation* to process computation - only
computing values when they are needed, which allows it to handle infinite lists.
This is a natural framework for robotics, where we have a robot operating for an
indefinite amount of time in the world, observing streams of sensor values and
requiring a stream of commands to follow. This is also the model used by ROS -
nodes run forever, always knowing how to publish the next value in the stream
they produce.

To integrate a robot with *Improv* for the first time, one must provide a
function which converts `Dance` data types to ROS message types. This is largest
barrier to extending *Improv* to other types of robots.

Example Programs
----------------

Below is a screenshot of what the author's screen looks like while using
*Improv*, using TurtleSim as the simulator. The author uses a vim-like terminal editor, but it should be
emphasized that any editor can be used to write *Improv* programs.

7. Conclusions
===========

So far in the project, work has mostly focused on the "plumbing" aspects: how to
monitor the input file, and compile user input to a ROS node. Now my focus is
shifting to the language design side of the project, as well as optimizing for
the cognitive criteria described earlier. To conclude, I will check in on how
well my project meets these criteria:

-   *Progressive Evaluation:* As seen by the minimal working example, it is
    fairly simple to get a program that does *something*. Every time the input
    file is saved, the user will get feedback on their program, either through a
    compiler error if they have incorrect syntax or from seeing the robot move.
    One problem that must be fixed is the somewhat large delay - about five
    seconds - between saving the file and seeing the updated simulation.
-   *Viscosity:* It is relatively easy to make a simple change, especially at
    the level of `Action`s - one can change the direction, origin, or size of an
    action easily.
-   *Closeness of mapping*: Some syntax requirements of Haskell can cause
    confusion. For instance, many errors can be caused by incorrect order of
    operations, which must be fixed by using parenthesis or the `$` operator to
    enforce the correct order of computation.

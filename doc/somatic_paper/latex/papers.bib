	Abstract = {
               This article deals with the rigid body collisions of planar kine matic chains with an external surface while in contact with other surfaces. Two solution procedures that cast the impact equations in differential and algebraic forms are developed to solve the general problem. The differential formulation can be used to obtain three sets of solutions based on the kinematic, kinetic, and energetic definitions of the coefficient of restitution, whereas the algebraic formulation can be used to obtain solu tions based on the approaches presented in Whittaker (1904) and Brach (1991). A specific example of a planar three-link chain with two contact points is studied to compare the out comes predicted by each approach. A particular emphasis is placed on the energy loss that results from the application of each solution scheme. The circumstances in which various methods lead to identical or distinct outcomes are investigated. Most importantly, the study elaborates on the rebounds at the noncolliding ends, a phenomenon that is observed only in multicontact collisions. The interaction of the chain with the contact surfaces at the noncolliding contact points is examined, and the differences in the prediction of rebounds that arise from using various methods are investigated.

@article{Blaya2004,
	Abstract = {An active ankle-foot orthoses (AAFO) is presented where the impedance of the orthotic joint is modulated throughout the walking cycle to treat drop-foot gait. During controlled plantar flexion, a biomimetic torsional spring control is applied where orthotic joint stiffness is actively adjusted to minimize forefoot collisions with the ground. Throughout late stance, joint impedance is minimized so as not to impede powered plantar flexion movements, and during the swing phase, a torsional spring-damper control lifts the foot to provide toe clearance. To assess the clinical effects of variable-impedance control, kinetic and kinematic gait data were collected on two drop-foot participants wearing the AAFO. For each participant, zero, constant, and variable impedance control strategies were evaluated and the results were compared to the mechanics of three age, weight, and height matched normals. We find that actively adjusting joint impedance reduces the occurrence of slap foot allows greater powered plantar flexion and provides for less kinematic difference during swing when compared to normals. These results indicate that a variable-impedance orthosis may have certain clinical benefits for the treatment of drop-foot gait compared to conventional ankle-foot orthoses having zero or constant stiffness joint behaviors.},

@article{Mathijssen2015,
	Abstract = {Human muscles contrast sharply with traditional robot actuators in that they consist of several motor units, connected in series and parallel, which can be progressively recruited. Some roboticists have explored this idea in robotic actuators, striving for improvements such as the ability to withstand partial damage, inexpensive repeatability by discrete open loop control, the potential of modular actuators, etc. These systems, however, become rather complex or rely on less widely used actuation techniques such as piezo-actuators or SMAs to produce a compact implementation. This paper presents a novel design of a modular redundant actuation unit which can be combined in various combinations to form compliant actuators with varying characteristics. The actuation unit consists of discretely activated solenoids with an integrated compliant coupling. This paper presents the working principle and the physical implementation in detail. Failure of a single motor unit will merely lead to a loss in performance rather than failure of the actuator. Since each motor unit is discrete, neither power electronics nor control require analog signals. Isometric experiments display the actuation characteristics and demonstrate the repeatability. The platform can be used in future work to further explore the virtues of exploiting discretization and redundancy in muscle-like control.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a robust location-aware activity recognition approach for establishing ambient intelligence applications in a smart home. With observations from a variety of multimodal and unobtrusive wireless sensors seamlessly integrated into ambient-intelligence compliant objects ({AICOs)}, the approach infers a single resident's interleaved activities by utilizing a generalized and enhanced Bayesian Network fusion engine with inputs from a set of the most informative features. These features are collected by ranking their usefulness in estimating activities of interest. Additionally, each feature reckons its corresponding reliability to control its contribution in cases of possible device failure, therefore making the system more tolerant to inevitable device failure or interference commonly encountered in a wireless sensor network, and thus improving overall robustness. This work is part of an interdisciplinary Attentive Home pilot project with the goal of fulfilling real human needs by utilizing context-aware attentive services. We have also created a novel application called {ldquoActivity} Maprdquo to graphically display ambient-intelligence-related contextual information gathered from both humans and the environment in a more convenient and user-accessible way. All experiments were conducted in an instrumented living lab and their results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.},

	Abstract = {Bayesian inference has been used successfully for many problems where the aim is to infer the parameters of a model of interest. In this paper we formulate the three dimensional reconstruction problem as the problem of inferring the parameters of a surface model from image data, and show how Bayesian methods can be used to estimate the parameters of this model given the image data. Thus we recover the three dimensional description of the scene. This approach also gives great flexibility. We can specify the geometrical properties of the model to suit our purpose, and can also use different models for how the surface reflects the light incident upon it. In common with other Bayesian inference problems, the estimation methodology requires that we can simulate the data that would have been recorded for any values of the model parameters. In this application this means that if we have image data we must be able to render the surface model. However it also means that we can infer the parameters of a model whose resolution can be chosen irrespective of the resolution of the images, and may be super-resolved. We present results of the inference of surface models from simulated aerial photographs for the case of super-resolution, where many surface elements project into a single pixel in the low-resolution images},

The goal of the paper is to present the various viewsof systems integration including lifecycle, architecture, process,interface, and enterprise, as well as product integration involvingsoftware and hardware. We examine systems engineering process,including several process models in an attempt to reveal theactivities associated with integration during the engineering ofsystems. We review the characteristics of interfaces betweensystems of systems and users that generally give rise to manysystems integration concerns. Without very careful effort atdeveloping an appropriate architecture for a system, there will belittle hope of integration.

	Abstract = {Events can be understood in terms of their temporal structure. The authors first draw on several bodies of research to construct an analysis of how people use event structure in perception, understanding, planning, and action. Philosophy provides a grounding for the basic units of events and actions. Perceptual psychology provides an analogy to object perception: Like objects, events belong to categories, and, like objects, events have parts. These relationships generate 2 hierarchical organizations for events: taxonomies and partonomies. Event partonomies have been studied by looking at how people segment activity as it happens. Structured representations of events can relate partonomy to goal relationships and causal structure; such representations have been shown to drive narrative comprehension, memory, and planning. Computational models provide insight into how mental representations might be organized and transformed. These different approaches to event structure converge on an explanation of how multiple sources of information interact in event perception and conception.},

@article{zhou_shape_2005,
	Abstract = {We derive a pair of algorithms, one optimal and the other approximate, for recognizing three-dimensional objects from a collection of points chosen from their surface according to some probabilistic mechanism. The measurements are assumed to be noisy, and the measured location of a given point is translated according to a noise probability distribution. Distributions governing surface point selection and measurement noise can take a variety of forms depending upon the particular measurement scenario. At one extreme, each measurement is assumed to yield values restricted to a one-dimensional ray, a special case commonly adopted in the literature. At the other extreme, measured points are chosen uniformly from the object{\^a}s surface, and the noise distribution is spherically symmetric, a worst-case scenario that involves no prior information about the measurements. We apply these two algorithms to shape recognition problems involving simple geometrical objects, and examine their relative behavior using a combination of analytical derivation and Monte Carlo simulation. We show that the approximate algorithm can be far simpler to compute, and its performance is competitive with the optimal algorithm when noise levels are relatively low. We show the existence of a critical noise level, beyond which the approximate algorithm exhibits catastrophic failure.},

Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and interpreting information from the environment to form situation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented. The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness research.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Evidence exists for a nonverbal capacity for the apprehension of number, in humans [1] (including infants [2] and [3]) and in other primates [4], [5] and [6]. Here, we show that perceived numerosity is susceptible to adaptation, like primary visual properties of a scene, such as color, contrast, size, and speed. Apparent numerosity was decreased by adaptation to large numbers of dots and increased by adaptation to small numbers, the effect depending entirely on the numerosity of the adaptor, not on contrast, size, orientation, or pixel density, and occurring with very low adaptor contrasts. We suggest that the visual system has the capacity to estimate numerosity and that it is an independent primary visual property, not reducible to others like spatial frequency or density of texture [7].{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The distinction between macrocognition and microcognition instantiates philosophical issues that contrast structuralism with functionalism (naturalism and holism). This is one of the thematic "pendulum swings" across the history of psychology. With regard to both experimentation and computational modeling, the issues that persist across history can be interpreted as cautionary tales, as constraints on methodologies, or as challenges.},

The method is designed to have three key features: accurate, practical, and applicable to a wide range of sensors. The method requires only a planar surface to be imaged from various poses. The calibration does not use depth discontinuities in the depth image, which makes it flexible and robust to noise. We apply this calibration to a Kinect device and present a new depth distortion model for the depth sensor. We perform experiments that show an improved accuracy with respect to the manufacturer's calibration.},

Active monitoring of networks is still largely the domain of human network managers and yet, the support tools provided to these operators are typically not integrated and dated in their interface design. Ecological interface design ({EID)} is a systematic approach, drawn from nuclear power plant control, for designing visualizations that uses a multi-level analysis to develop graphics designed to support problem solving and management activities. We demonstrate the adaptation of this approach to network management and show how visualization tools can be designed. Finally we evaluated the {EID} tool against an industry tool, {HPOpenView} Network Node Manager in a series of detection and diagnosis tasks. While we observed slightly faster detection times with Network Node Manager, the {EID} tool generated faster diagnosis times and more accurate diagnoses. Finally we took our tool to professional network managers for a qualitative evaluation.},

@article{rowley_wisdom_2007,
	Abstract = {This paper revisits the data-information-knowledge-wisdom ({DIKW)} hierarchy by examining the articulation of the hierarchy in a number of widely read textbooks, and analysing their statements about the nature of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. The hierarchy referred to variously as the {{\^a}Knowledge} Hierarchy{\^a}, the {{\^a}Information} Hierarchy{\^a} and the {{\^a}Knowledge} Pyramid{\^a} is one of the fundamental, widely recognized and {\^a}taken-for-granted{\^a} models in the information and knowledge literatures. It is often quoted, or used implicitly, in definitions of data, information and knowledge in the information management, information systems and knowledge management literatures, but there has been limited direct discussion of the hierarchy. After revisiting Ackoff{\^a}s original articulation of the hierarchy, definitions of data, information, knowledge and wisdom as articulated in recent textbooks in information systems and knowledge management are reviewed and assessed, in pursuit of a consensus on definitions and transformation processes. This process brings to the surface the extent of agreement and dissent in relation to these definitions, and provides a basis for a discussion as to whether these articulations present an adequate distinction between data, information, and knowledge. Typically information is defined in terms of data, knowledge in terms of information, and wisdom in terms of knowledge, but there is less consensus in the description of the processes that transform elements lower in the hierarchy into those above them, leading to a lack of definitional clarity. In addition, there is limited reference to wisdom in these texts.},

@phdthesis{hanheide_cognitive_2006,
	Abstract = {With increasing computational power and decreasing size, computers nowadays are already wearable and mobile. They become attendant of peoples' everyday life. Personal digital assistants and mobile phones equipped with adequate software gain a lot of interest in public, although the functionality they provide in terms of assistance is little more than a mobile databases for appointments, addresses, to-do lists and photos. Compared to the assistance a human can provide, such systems are hardly to call real assistants. The motivation to construct more human-like assistance systems that develop a certain level of cognitive capabilities leads to the exploration of two central paradigms in this work. The first paradigm is termed cognitive vision systems. Such systems take human cognition as a design principle of underlying concepts and develop learning and adaptation capabilities to be more flexible in their application. They are embodied, active, and situated. Second, the ego-vision paradigm is introduced as a very tight interaction scheme between a user and a computer system that especially eases close collaboration and assistance between these two. Ego-vision systems ({EVS)} take a user's (visual) perspective and integrate the human in the system's processing loop by means of a shared perception and augmented reality. {EVSs} adopt techniques of cognitive vision to identify objects, interpret actions, and understand the user's visual perception. And they articulate their knowledge and interpretation by means of augmentations of the user's own view. These two paradigms are studied as rather general concepts, but always with the goal in mind to realize more flexible assistance systems that closely collaborate with its users. This work provides three major contributions. First, a definition and explanation of ego-vision as a novel paradigm is given. Benefits and challenges of this paradigm are discussed as well. Second, a configuration of different approaches that permit an ego-vision system to perceive its environment and its user is presented in terms of object and action recognition, head gesture recognition, and mosaicing. These account for the specific challenges identified for ego-vision systems, whose perception capabilities are based on wearable sensors only. Finally, a visual active memory ({VAM)} is introduced as a flexible conceptual architecture for cognitive vision systems in general, and for assistance systems in particular. It adopts principles of human cognition to develop a representation for information stored in this memory. So-called memory processes continuously analyze, modify, and extend the content of this {VAM.} The functionality of the integrated system emerges from their coordinated interplay of these memory processes. An integrated assistance system applying the approaches and concepts outlined before is implemented on the basis of the visual active memory. The system architecture is discussed and some exemplary processing paths in this system are presented and discussed. It assists users in object manipulation tasks and has reached a maturity level that allows to conduct user studies.

	Abstract = {Entertainment and gaming systems such as the Wii and {XBox} Kinect have brought touchless, body-movement based interfaces to the masses. Systems like these enable the estimation of movements of various body parts from raw inertial motion or depth sensor data. However, the interface developer is still left with the challenging task of creating a system that recognizes these movements as embodying meaning. The machine learning approach for tackling this problem requires the collection of data sets that contain the relevant body movements and their associated semantic labels. These data sets directly impact the accuracy and performance of the gesture recognition system and should ideally contain all natural variations of the movements associated with a gesture. This paper addresses the problem of collecting such gesture datasets. In particular, we investigate the question of what is the most appropriate semiotic modality of instructions for conveying to human subjects the movements the system developer needs them to perform. The results of our qualitative and quantitative analysis indicate that the choice of modality has a significant impact on the performance of the learnt gesture recognition system; particularly in terms of correctness and coverage.},

	Abstract = {Methodologies for assessing human judgment in complex domains are important for the design of both displays that inform judgment and automated systems that suggest judgments. This paper uses the n-system lens model to evaluate the impact of displays on human judgment and to explicitly assess the similarity between human judgments and a set of potential judgment algorithms for use in automated systems. First, the need for and concepts underlying judgment analysis are outlined. Then the n-system lens model and its parameters are formally described. This model is then used to examine a previously conducted study of aircraft collision detection that had been analyzed using standard analysis of variance methods. Our analysis found the same main effects as did the earlier analysis. However, n-system lens model analysis was able to provide greater insight into the information relied upon for judgments and the impact of displays on judgment. Additionally, the analysis was able to identify attributes of human judgments that were {\^a} and were not {\^a} similar to judgments produced by automated systems. Potential applications of this research include automated aid design and operator training.},

@article{rude_quantifying_2012,
	Abstract = {Experimental weather radars are being developed that could enhance the severe weather warning process by providing higher resolution data sensed closer to the ground and with faster update rates. Because wind speed is an important criterion in the issuance of severe thunderstorm warnings, this research investigates the impact of adding these new data to the forecaster decision-making process. In a static case review setting, 30 National Weather Service ({NWS)} forecasters evaluated six convective weather cases under two conditions: (1) using (conventional) {WSR-88D} weather radar data, and, (2) using both {WSR-88D} and additional data from an experimental four-radar network. Forecasters' predictions of ground level wind gusts, 2{\^a}5 min into the future, were compared to measurements from ground-based wind sensors. When provided with the additional radar data participants significantly improved the accuracy of their wind speed assessments (absolute error reduced from 5.9 m s{\^a}1 to 4.0 m s{\^a}1; p {\textless} 0.001), increased their assessment confidence ratings (p {\textless} 0.001), forecasted significantly greater wind speeds (20.4 m s{\^a}1 as opposed to 17.1 m s{\^a}1; p {\textless} 0.001), and increased the number of affirmative decisions to warn from 15 to 35 (p = 0.001). While the addition of high resolution, low altitude, rapidly updating radar data is shown to have both qualitative and quantitative benefits, training and warning policy implications for the incorporation of new technology must also be carefully considered as increased accuracy, confidence and higher wind speed estimates may lead to more warnings.},

	Abstract = {Notes that an accumulating body of research on clinical judgment, decision making, and probability estimation has documented a substantial lack of ability of both experts and nonexperts. However, evidence shows that people have great confidence in their fallible judgment. This article examines how this contradiction can be resolved and, in so doing, discusses the relationship between learning and experience. The basic tasks that are considered involve judgments made for the purpose of choosing between actions. At some later time, outcome feedback is used for evaluating the accuracy of judgment. The manner in which judgments of the contingency between predictions and outcomes are made is discussed and is related to the difficulty people have in searching for disconfirming information to test hypotheses. A model for learning and maintaining confidence in one's own judgment is developed that includes the effects of experience and both the frequency and importance of positive and negative feedback.

@inproceedings{martin_real-time_2012,
	Abstract = {Laborers in factories all across the world perform physically intensive tasks daily. With every lift they put themselves at risk of injury. Many still-frame modeling systems exist that can assess the different stresses and strains on the laborers body given his or her position. These models are only usable by experts, and do not allow for real-time alerts. In 1995, companies in the United States lost \$50 billion due to injured employee absences and compensation settlements. Companies are not only eager to reduce their overhead costs, but also aim to better society by offering more robust worker safety practices. The focus of this project was to design a system that can be used in a training environment. Our system is used to teach employees if their current lifting and carrying methods can be detrimental to their health. Our system is designed to be used for longstanding employees as well as new hires. This project's primary requirement was to implement a motion sensing device to aid in the analysis of ergonomics in an industrial environment. To do this we proposed to make use of Microsoft Kinect{\^A}{\copyright} sensors. The Kinect{\^A}{\copyright} is able to provide skeletal tracking at 30 frames/second for two individuals in the field of view. To develop the system we selected the Microsoft software development kit ({SDK)} from a large variety of alternative professional and open source {SDKs} because of a variety of desirable features. A static ergonomic model was integrated with the Kinect{\^A}{\copyright} software. Multiple other software packages were assessed for compatibility with the Kinect{\^A}{\copyright} in an effort to enhance the {Kinects'O} ability to recognize objects and humans. After development was complete the system was tested by analyzing our system's output using different skeletal lift positions to compare to the real results. Our system provides real-time ergonomic analysis of lifts performed by humans. This system lacks the ability to recognize specific individuals and obj- cts necessary to customize the system to adequately evaluate a lift, and has not been tested in a factory environment. In the future we hope to implement a dynamic ergonomic model so that it can recognize whole movements or gestures which lead to injury, rather than recognizing a single position. Our system successfully outputs a number for the recommended weight limit as well as other methods to measure the strain on a worker's skeleton. In a training environment the system will help individuals correct the problems with their lifting motions.},

	Abstract = {Enabled by a dense network of Doppler weather radars with overlapping coverage, Distributed Collaborative Adaptive Sensing ({DCAS)} represents a new paradigm in remote sensing. Rather than each radar periodically sampling its surroundings with sit-and-spin volume coverage patterns as with today's {NEXRAD} weather radars, {DCAS} is an end-user driven approach that targets sensitivity when and where the needs of its end-users are greatest. The advantage is that by adaptively allocating sensitivity, higher quality measurements are possible due to the ability to dwell longer in volumes where echoes are weak, sample faster in volumes with rapidly evolving dynamics, and obtain multi-Doppler looks for high accuracy wind field retrieval. This paper describes the multiuser, multi-attribute utilities-based approach being used to coordinate the scanning activities of the weather radars in the first prototype {DCAS} system being fielded by the National Science Foundation sponsored Engineering Research Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere ({CASA-} {ERC).}},

	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the way in which decisions are made by highly proficient personnel, under conditions of extreme time pressure, and in environments where the consequences of the decisions could affect lives and property. The domain of firefighting was selected, and the research focused on the decisions made by fire ground commanders ({FGCs).} Interviews were conducted with 26 experienced {FGCs} (mean experience of 23 years). Each interview covered a critical incident that was nonroutine and that demanded expertise. A total of 156 decision points were probed in this way. In less than 12\% of them was there any evidence of simultaneous comparisons and relative evaluation of two or more options. In over 80\% of the decision points, the strategy was for the {FGCs} to use their experience to directly identify the situation as typical of a standard prototype and to identify a course of action as typical for that prototype. In this way, the {FGCs} handled decision points without any need to consider more than one option. A recognition-primed decision ({RPD)} model was synthesized from these data, which emphasized the use of recognition rather than calculation or analysis for rapid decision making.},

Twelve meteorologists were asked to make probabilistic forecasts of significant and severe weather events under three information conditions. Forecast accuracy was generally low. As the amount and quality of the information increased substantially, there was a modest increase in the accuracy of the forecasts. However, the results suggest that the forecasters were least consistent when they had the most information to work with, partially reducing the benefits of the increased information.},

The timid and the fainthearted, and the people that expect quick results, are doomed to {disappointment."According} to W. Edwards Deming, American companies require nothing less than a transformation of management style and of governmental relations with industry. In Out of the Crisis, originally published in 1982, Deming offers a theory of management based on his famous 14 Points for Management. Management's failure to plan for the future, he claims, brings about loss of market, which brings about loss of jobs. Management must be judged not only by the quarterly dividend, but by innovative plans to stay in business, protect investment, ensure future dividends, and provide more jobs through improved product and service. In simple,direct language, he explains the principles of management transformation and how to apply them. Previously published by {MIT-CAES}},

@article{parasuraman_human-computer_1987,
	Abstract = {Attentional factors can influence user interaction with automated and semiautomated monitoring systems. Three aspects of human-computer monitoring are considered in this paper: (1) vigilance effects in complex monitoring tasks, (2) factors influencing optimal combination of human and computer monitors, and (3) effects of increased automation on the relationship between mental workload and vigilance. Results of laboratory and simulation studies suggest that vigilance effects can limit performance in complex monitoring tasks. Performance deficits may occur because of either vigilance decrement over time or sustained low levels of vigilance. However, the specific factors that influence sustained performance with complex displays have not been identified precisely. Computer assistance to enhance performance is feasible but may not be effective in all cases. Performance gain is dependent on several factors, including the decision rule for combining human and computer decisions and the level of mental workload imposed on the human monitor. Finally, in assessing the impact of increased automation the beneficial effects on mental workload have to be traded off against possible adverse effects on vigilance. The implications of these factors for the design of automated monitoring systems are discussed.},

Measurements in optically clear air and/or widespread precipitation are simulated, using horizontally uniform wind fields that vary with height. Vertical profiles of wind speed and direction indicated by the simulated Doppler velocity fields agree well with Doppler radar measurements. Horizontally uniform winds veering with height produce a striking S-shaped pattern, indicative of warm air advection; winds backing with height produce a backward S, indicative of cold air advection. A maximum in the vertical profile of wind speed is indicated by a pair of concentric contours, one upwind and one downwind of the radar. The presence of a frontal discontinuity is indicated by rapid variation of wind direction within the frontal zone. The wind speed profile controls the overall pattern including the spacing between contours, whereas the vertical profile of wind direction controls contour curvature.},

@article{meyer_why_2002,
	Abstract = {Descriptions of a dynamic warning system usually assign the system certain diagnostic values. Operators should adjust their responses to these values when considering the output of the system for their decisions. This approach is not necessarily appropriate for complex systems that are controlled by human operators. Here the operators' actions are likely to change the frequency of events that should trigger a warning. Consequently the operator will change the predictive value of a warning system that is imperfectly correlated with the monitored events. In general its diagnostic value decreases for better operators. This phenomenon is demonstrated on the example of binary warnings about binary events, and an empirical demonstration of the phenomenon is provided in an experimental study of a process control task. Actual or potential applications of this research include improved understanding of the determinants of operators'responses to warnings, which should help in the design of better warning systems.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a research program that addresses a variety of issues and problems in training pilots to fly modern, highly sophisticated aircraft First, the paper describes two intelligent tutors developed to teach two important aspects of aviation: a tutor that teaches management of the vertical dimension of the flight management system for pilots in transition training; and a tutor that teaches expert novices, that is, certified pilots, procedures not included in their transition training. Second, both tutors extend {GT-ITACS} (Georgia Tech-Intelligent Tutoring Architecture for Complex Systems), a computational development environment for intelligent tutors. In general, implementing instructional material in computational form is the most difficult step in developing effective computer-based instruction; this is particularly true for intelligent tutors Computational implementation is so difficult that implementing computer-based training is often cost and time prohibitive{\^a}explaining in part the small number of tutors and the abundance of computer-based training that is little more than Power Point presentations {GT-ITACS} is an computational architecture that is completely file driven That is, configuring a {GT-ITACS} tutor for a new application requires only reformatting input files. A tutor based on {GT-ITACS} does not require any additional software development or {\^a}hard-coding.{\^a} Both tutors described in this paper instantiate {GT-ITACS}, demonstrating the versatility and power of the development environment. Finally, the paper concludes by describing a method to implement distributed, computer-based training, that is, training any time, any where A description of an easily implemented method, evaluated with both tutors described in this paper, provides users access to training at the place and time of their choice.},

	Abstract = {The recently established National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere ({CASA)} will be deploying the first generation of an automated network of four low-power, short-range, X-band, polarimetric, Doppler radars, known as {NetRad}, in central Oklahoma in late 2005. This network is developed with the goal of tracking tornadoes with high spatial and temporal resolution as well as mapping severe weather events in the lowest 2 km of the troposphere. Each radar node has been developed to accomplish this system goal through the coordinated interaction with other radars in the network via a real-time, closed-loop software control system. This paper will describe the characteristics of the individual radar nodes in the system, with emphasis on those aspects of the design that lend themselves toward operation as a coordinated network. Calibration results and performance characteristics of the single node radar of the first generation system will also be presented.},

	Abstract = {As an extension to the popular hidden Markov model ({HMM)}, a hidden semi-Markov model ({HSMM)} allows the underlying stochastic process to be a semi-Markov chain. Each state has variable duration and a number of observations being produced while in the state. This makes it suitable for use in a wider range of applications. Its forward{\^a}backward algorithms can be used to estimate/update the model parameters, determine the predicted, filtered and smoothed probabilities, evaluate goodness of an observation sequence fitting to the model, and find the best state sequence of the underlying stochastic process. Since the {HSMM} was initially introduced in 1980 for machine recognition of speech, it has been applied in thirty scientific and engineering areas, such as speech recognition/synthesis, human activity recognition/prediction, handwriting recognition, functional {MRI} brain mapping, and network anomaly detection. There are about three hundred papers published in the literature. An overview of {HSMMs} is presented in this paper, including modelling, inference, estimation, implementation and applications. It first provides a unified description of various {HSMMs} and discusses the general issues behind them. The boundary conditions of {HSMM} are extended. Then the conventional models, including the explicit duration, variable transition, and residential time of {HSMM}, are discussed. Various duration distributions and observation models are presented. Finally, the paper draws an outline of the applications.},

	Abstract = {The recognition-primed decision ({RPD)} model (Klein, 1993) is an account of expert decision making that focuses on how experts recognize situations as being similar to past experienced events and thus rely on memory and experience to make decisions. A number of computational models exist that attempt to account for similar aspects of expert decision making. In this paper, I briefly review these extant models and propose the Bayesian recognitional decision model ({BRDM)}, a Bayesian implementation of the {RPD} model based primarily on models of episodic recognition memory (Mueller \& Shiffrin, 2006; Shiffrin \& Steyvers, 1997). The proposed model accounts for three important factors used by experts to make decisions: evidence about a current situation, the prior base rate of events in the environment, and the reliability of the information reporter. The Bayesian framework integrates these three aspects of information together in an optimal way and provides a principled framework for understanding recognitional decision processes.},

It is important for cognitive system integration that measures be not only reliable and valid but also unobtrusive and capable of providing predictive and diagnostic information in real time. To achieve these objectives we have developed measures of systems (in our case, small teams of humans) that are based heavily on the automated sequential analysis of communication data. These measures have been mapped to system performance, system change, system process, coordination, and situation awareness and thus are of potential value for cognitive system integration activities.},

@article{wood_technique_2001,
	Abstract = {The Doppler velocity signature of a thunderstorm mesocyclone becomes increasingly degraded as distance from the radar increases. Degradation is due to the broadening of the radar beam with range relative to the size of the mesocyclone. Using a model mesocyclone and a simulated {WSR-88D} Doppler radar, a potential approach for improving the detection of mesocyclones is investigated. The approach involves decreasing the azimuthal sampling interval from the conventional 1.0{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ to 0.5{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$. Using model mesocyclones that cover the spread of expected mesocyclone sizes and strengths, simulations show that stronger mesocyclone signatures consistently are produced when radar data are collected at 0.5{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ azimuthal increments. Consequently, the distance from the radar at which a mesocyclone of a given strength and size can be detected increases by an average of at least 50\% when data are collected using 0.5{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ azimuthal increments. The simulated findings are tested using Archive Level I (time series) data collected by the {WSR-88D} Operational Support Facility{\^a}s {KCRI} radar during the {Oklahoma{\^a}Kansas} tornado outbreak of 3 May 1999. With the availability of time series data, an Archive Level {II} dataset was produced for both 1.0{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ and 0.5{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ azimuthal intervals. One-third of the mesocyclone signatures collected using 0.5{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ azimuthal intervals were 10\% to over 50\% stronger than their 1.0{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ azimuthal interval counterparts.},

@article{bisantz_making_1994,
	Abstract = {The abstraction hierarchy ({AH)} is a multileveled representation framework, consisting of physical and functional system models, which has been proposed as a useful framework for developing representations of complex work environments. Despite the fact that the {AH} is well known and widely cited in the cognitive engineering community, there are surprisingly few examples of its application. Accordingly, the intent of this paper is to provide a concrete example of how the {AH} can be applied as a knowledge representation framework. A formal instantiation of the {AH} as the basis for a computer program is presented in the context of a thermal-hydraulic process. This model of the system is complemented by a relatively simple reasoning mechanism which is independent of the information contained in the knowledge representation. This reasoning mechanism uses the {AH} model, along with qualitative user input about system states, to generate reasoning trajectories for different types of events and problems. Simulation outputs showing how the {AH} model can provide an effective basis for reasoning under different classes of situations, including challenging faults of various types, are presented. These detailed examples illustrate the various benefits of adopting the {AH} as a knowledge representation framework, namely: providing sufficient representations to allow reasoning about unanticipated fault and control situations, allowing the use of reasoning mechanisms that are independent of domain information, and having psychological relevance.},

	Abstract = {The decision-making literature contains considerable information about how humans approach tasks involving uncertainty using heuristics. Although there is some reason to believe that weather forecasters are not identical in all respects to the typical subjects used in judgment and decision-making studies, there also is evidence that weather forecasters are not so different that the existing understanding of human cognition as it relates to making decisions is entirely inapplicable to weather forecasters. Accordingly, some aspects of cognition and decision making are reviewed and considered in terms of how they apply to human weather forecasters, including biases introduced by heuristics. Considerable insight into human forecasting could be gained by applying available studies of the cognitive psychology of decision making. What few studies exist that have used weather forecasters as subjects suggest that further work might well be productive in terms of helping to guide the improvement of weather forecasts by humans. It is concluded that a multidisciplinary approach, involving disciplines outside of meteorology, needs to be developed and supported if there is to be a future role for humans in forecasting the weather.},

We present a complete software and hardware framework for implementing the system, which is based on an array of commodity Microsoft Kinect{\^a}¢color-plus-depth cameras. Novel contributions include an algorithm for merging data between multiple depth cameras and techniques for automatic color calibration and preserving stereo quality even with low rendering rates. Also presented is a solution to the problem of interference that occurs between Kinect cameras with overlapping views. Emphasis is placed on a fully {GPU-accelerated} data processing and rendering pipeline that can apply hole filling, smoothing, data merger, surface generation, and color correction at rates of up to 100 million triangles/sec on a single {PC} and graphics board. Also presented is a Kinect-based marker-less tracking system that combines {2D} eye recognition with depth information to allow head-tracked stereo views to be rendered for a parallax barrier autostereoscopic display. Our system is affordable and reproducible, offering the opportunity to easily deliver {3D} telepresence beyond the researcher's lab.},

Design is central to the practice of systems engineering and systems engineers understand that design is a creative, iterative, decision-making process. In this paper, we provide an overview of design from the perspective of the systems engineer. We review the steps in the design process and consider the characteristic activities, techniques, and tools of systems engineering in terms of how these activities support the central mission of systems design. We briefly discuss some of the major influences on current design research. Of particular interest is the axiomatic theory of design developed from the perspective of manufacturing engineering, which ultimately leads to a set of design principles, rules, and practices which are embodied in Design for Manufacture ({DFM).} {DFM} is a systems approach to improving the competitiveness of a manufacturing enterprise by developing products that are easier, faster, and less expensive to make, while maintaining required standards of functionality, quality, and marketability.

	Abstract = {A theoretical framework for designing interfaces for complex human-machine systems is proposed. The framework, called ecological interface design ({EID)}, is based on the skills, rules, and knowledge taxonomy of cognitive control. The basic goals of {EID} are not to force processing to a higher level than the demands of the task require, and to support each of the three levels of cognitive control. Thus, an {EID} interface should not contribute to the difficulty of the task, and at the same time, it should support the entire range of activities that operators will be faced with. Three prescriptive design principles are suggested to achieve this objective, each directed at supporting a particular level of cognitive control. Particular attention is paid to presenting a coherent deductive argument justifying the principles of {EID.} Support for the {EID} framework is discussed. Some issues for future research are outlined},

	Abstract = {Markerless tracking of human pose is a hard yet relevant problem. In this paper, we derive an efficient filtering algorithm for tracking human pose using a stream of monocular depth images. The key idea is to combine an accurate generative model - which is achievable in this setting using programmable graphics hardware - with a discriminative model that provides data-driven evidence about body part locations. In each filter iteration, we apply a form of local model-based search that exploits the nature of the kinematic chain. As fast movements and occlusion can disrupt the local search, we utilize a set of discriminatively trained patch classifiers to detect body parts. We describe a novel algorithm for propagating this noisy evidence about body part locations up the kinematic chain using the unscented transform. The resulting distribution of body configurations allows us to reinitialize the model-based search. We provide extensive experimental results on 28 real-world sequences using automatic ground-truth annotations from a commercial motion capture system.},

	Abstract = {We present a method for real-time monitoring of workflows in a constrained environment. The monitoring system should not only be able to recognise the current step but also provide instructions about the possible next steps in an ongoing workflow. In this paper, we address this issue by using a robust approach ({HMM-pLSA)} which relies on a Hidden Markov Model ({HMM)} and generative model such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis ({pLSA).} The proposed method exploits the dynamics of the qualitative spatial relation between pairs of objects involved in a workflow. The novel view-invariant relational feature is based on distance and its rate of change in {3D} space. The multiple pair-wise relational features are represented in a multi-dimensional relational state space using an {HMM.} The workflow monitoring task is inferred from the relational state space using {pLSA} on datasets, which consist of workflow activities such as {\^a}hammering nails{\^a} and {\^a}driving screws{\^a}. The proposed approach is evaluated for both {\^a}off-line{\^a} (complete observation) and {\^a}on-line{\^a} (partial observation). The evaluation of the novel approach justifies the robustness of the technique in overcoming issues of noise evolving from object tracking and occlusions.},

	Abstract = {In this paper an algorithmic framework for posture analysis using a single view {3D} {TOF} camera is presented. The {3D} human posture parameters are recovered automatically from range data without the usage of body markers. A topological approach is investigated in order to define descriptors suitable to estimate location of body parts and orientation of body articulations. Two Morse function are exploited, the first one provides an Euclidean distance mapping helpful to deal with body self-occlusions. The second Morse function is based on geodesic distance and provides an extended Discrete Reeb Graph description of the main body parts that are head, torso, arms and legs. Geodesic distance function exhibits the property of invariance under isometric transformations that typically occur when the human body changes its posture. The geodesic map of the body is obtained with a two steps procedure. Firstly, a Delaunay meshing is carried out starting from the depth map provided by the {3D} {TOF} camera; secondly, geodesic distances are computed applying Dijkstra algorithm to previously computed mesh. Moreover, a re-meshing method is proposed in order to deal with self-occlusion problem which occurs in the depth data when a human body is partially occluded by other body segments. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to classifying four main postures: standing, lying, sitting and bending.},

Data collection and analysis techniques are described. Wind spectra from five weak-to-strong tornadoes and from one violent tornado are presented and discussed in conjunction with simultaneous boresighted video documentation, photogrammetric analysis, and damage {surveys.Maximum} Doppler wind speeds of 55{\^a}105 m s{\^a}1 were found in five of the tornadoes; wind speeds as high as 120{\^a}125 m s{\^a} were found in a large tornado during an outbreak on 26 April 1991. These may be the highest wind speeds ever measured by Doppler radar and the first radar measurements of F-5 intensity wind speeds. The variation in the spectrum across the 26 April 1991 tornado is presented. Standard and mobile soundings, and surface data, used to determine the {\^a}thermodynamic speed limit{\^a} indicate that it was usually exceeded by 50\%{\^a}100\%.

The purpose of this survey is to give an overview and categorization of the approaches used. We concentrate on approaches that aim on classification of full-body motions, such as kicking, punching, and waving, and we categorize them according to how they represent the spatial and temporal structure of actions; how they segment actions from an input stream of visual data; and how they learn a view-invariant representation of actions.},

An assessment is made on how these radars and related changes at National Weather Service Offices have impacted the warning of tornadoes. Tornado warning statistics were employed to evaluate the improvements in warning lead times and detection after the installation of the {WSR-88D.} In an effort to remove a bias from the warning dataset, the statistics based on the first tornado event of each day were also considered. This early evaluation of the warning capability of these radars indicates an improvement at selected sites over the previous five years.},

@article{fischhoff_hindsight_1975,
	Abstract = {Notes that a major difference between historical and nonhistorical judgment is that the historical judge typically knows how things turned out. 3 experiments are described with a total of 479 college students. In Exp I, receipt of such outcome knowledge was found to increase the postdicted likelihood of reported events and change the perceived relevance of event-descriptive data, regardless of the likelihood of the outcome and the truth of the report. Ss were, however, largely unaware of the effect that outcome knowledge had on their perceptions. As a result, they overestimated what they would have known without outcome knowledge (Exp {II)}, as well as what others (Exp {III)} actually did know without outcome knowledge. It is argued that this lack of awareness can seriously restrict one's ability to judge or learn from the past. (16 ref) ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2010 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

The emerging field of Naturalistic Decision Making ({NDM)} is at a point to afford system developers (including design engineers, human factors engineers, ergonomics specialists) different tools and methods for designing interfaces/systems that will better support decision making in those settings. Decision requirements can be identified from the early conceptual design phase through redesign. The {NDM} framework attempts to describe the way in which people handle difficult conditions within the context of the overall setting or task. This {SOAR} describes various decision strategies used by individuals and teams to assess a situation, diagnose a problem, and select a course of action. The impact of stress upon these strategies is also considered. To help understand what people are thinking as they perform difficult tasks, the procedures for conducting Cognitive Task Analyses to examine design requirements are also examined.},

@article{brotzge_tornadoes_2010,
	Abstract = {During a five-year period of study from 2000 to 2004, slightly more than 26\% of all reported tornadoes across the {U.S.} occurred without a {NWS} warning being issued. This study examines some of the reasons behind why no warnings were issued with these tornadoes, and what climatological, storm classification, and sociological factors may have played a role in the lack of warnings. This data set of tornado records was sorted by F-scale, geographically by region and weather forecast office ({WFO)}, hour of the day, month of the year, tornado path length, tornado-to-radar distance, county population density, and number of tornadoes by day and order of {occurrence.Results} show that the tornadoes most likely to strike when the public is least likely to be aware were also those tornadoes with the greatest chance of not being warned. Singular tornado events (one tornado report per day within a {WFO} County Warning Area) and the first tornado report of the day were the most difficult scenarios on which to warn, with over half of all solitary tornado events not warned. Geographic areas that experienced a significant proportion of weak, solitary, and/or nocturnal tornadoes had a much higher ratio of missed warnings. In general, the stronger the tornado, as estimated from its F-scale and/or track length, the greater chance it was warned. However, the tornado distance from radar had a significant impact on tornado warning statistics. In addition, many weak tornadoes were not warned, and the overall ratio of missed tornado warnings to reported tornadoes actually increased over more densely populated regions, likely due to more complete post-event verification.},

hampered by the complexity of data, display limitations and the

discusses aspects in the development of a multi-modal visualization

The framework adopts the Complex Adaptive Systems modelling approach, and proposes the agent-based simulation as cognitive tool for the team which designs the plans. The formative evacuation plans, which are developed using the proposed framework, do not prescribe normative procedures but provide recommendations that decrease the problem space of the personnel, and at the same time permit them to adapt to the particularities of the situation at hand. The framework is demonstrated through an application in a metro system, for the case of a flaming train stalled between two stations.},

Previous accounts [e.g., Cowan (Acad Manage Rev 11(4):763{\^a}776, 1986)] described problem detection as the accumulation of discrepancies until a threshold was reached. In reviewing incidents taken from a variety of natural settings, we found that discrepancy accumulation did not apply to the incidents we reviewed, because (a) cues to problems may be subtle and context-dependent, and (b) what counts as a discrepancy depends on the problem-solver{\^a}s experience and the stance taken in interpreting the situation.

	Abstract = {New system design often focuses on opportunities afforded by technology without careful analysis of the needs of the people and work involved. A strong consensus has been found across diverse design traditions regarding the need for in-depth analysis of the context of use to inform system design. Analysis of context of use encompasses identifying and characterizing the range of situations that can arise, the demands they impose, and the motivations and activities of the people involved. This paper presents three case studies in which context of use analysis was a key part of successful system design. The three case studies represent work-centered design, emerging from cognitive engineering and cognitive systems engineering; interaction design, emerging from industrial and communication design; and participatory design, emerging from the Scandinavian labor movement. The case studies highlight commonalities in experience and core tenets across traditions. They argue for the importance of incorporating context of use analyses as part of the systems engineering process and illustrate a variety of approaches for context of use analysis.},

@article{helbing_self-organized_2005,
	Abstract = {To test simulation models of pedestrian flows,we have performed experiments for corridors, bottleneck areas, and intersections. Our evaluations of video recordings show that the geometric boundary conditions are not only relevant for the capacity of the elements of pedestrian facilities, they also influence the time gap distribution of pedestrians, indicating the existence of self-organization phenomena. After calibration of suitable models, these findings can be used to improve design elements of pedestrian facilities and egress routes. It turns out that "obstacles" can stabilize flow patterns and make them more fluid. Moreover, intersecting flows can be optimized, utilizing the phenomenon of "stripe formation." We also suggest increasing diameters of egress routes in stadia, theaters, and lecture halls to avoid long waiting times for people in the back, and shock waves due to impatience in cases of emergency evacuation. Moreover, zigzag-shaped geometries and columns can educe the pressure in panicking crowds. The proposed design solutions are expected to increase the efficiency and safety of train stations, airport terminals, stadia, theaters, public buildings, and mass events in the future. As application examples we mention the evacuation of passenger ships and the simulation of pilgrim streams on the Jamarat bridge. Adaptive escape guidance systems, optimal way systems, and simulations of urban pedestrian flows are addressed as well. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

	Abstract = {In daily living, person often performs quite differently for finishing the same semantic task, because of her/his mood and the scene state of that time. A large amount of variations are caused by personal petty actions, aimless wandering and additive actions in special scenes, which we term irrelevant events. In this paper, we explore how activities containing sparse irrelevant events can be recognized. We introduce an irrelevant event state into hidden semi-Markov model to cover variations because of irrelevant events. The proposed model remains the partial order of sub-events of the activity of interest, and keeps its discriminability from others with the help of higher-order Markov setting. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach for human activity recognition.},

@article{maier_architecting_1998,
	Abstract = {While the phrase ldquosystem-of-systemsrdquo is commonly seen, there is less agreement on what they are, how they may be distinguished from ldquoconventionalrdquo systems, or how their development differs from other systems. This paper proposes a definition, a limited taxonomy, and a basic set of architecting principles to assist in their design. As it turns out, the term system-of-systems is infelicitous for the taxonomic grouping. The grouping might be better termed ldquocollaborative systems.rdquo The paper also discusses the value of recognizing the classification in system design, and some of the problems induced by misclassification. One consequence of the classification is the identification of principal structuring heuristics for system-of-systems. Another is an understanding that, in most cases, the architecture of a system-of-systems is communications. The architecture is nonphysical, it is the set of standards that allow meaningful communication among the components. This is illustrated through existing and proposed systems. {\"\i}¿{\oe} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Syst Eng 1: 267-284, 1998},

The networks are comprised of 1-meter antennas that transmit 10's of W peak power and are capable of high-speed electronic beam-steering.

	Abstract = {Action selection is a fundamental decision process for us, and depends on the state of both our body and the environment. Because signals in our sensory and motor systems are corrupted by variability or noise, the nervous system needs to estimate these states. To select an optimal action these state estimates need to be combined with knowledge of the potential costs or rewards of different action outcomes. We review recent studies that have investigated the mechanisms used by the nervous system to solve such estimation and decision problems, which show that human behaviour is close to that predicted by Bayesian Decision Theory. This theory defines optimal behaviour in a world characterized by uncertainty, and provides a coherent way of describing sensorimotor processes.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a cognitive vision system capable of autonomously learning protocols from perceptual observations of dynamic scenes. The work is motivated by the aim of creating a synthetic agent that can observe a scene containing interactions between unknown objects and agents, and learn models of these sufficient to act in accordance with the implicit protocols present in the scene. Discrete concepts (utterances and object properties), and temporal protocols involving these concepts, are learned in an unsupervised manner from continuous sensor input alone. Crucial to this learning process are methods for spatio-temporal attention applied to the audio and visual sensor data. These identify subsets of the sensor data relating to discrete concepts. Clustering within continuous feature spaces is used to learn object property and utterance models from processed sensor data, forming a symbolic description. The progol Inductive Logic Programming system is subsequently used to learn symbolic models of the temporal protocols presented in the presence of noise and over-representation in the symbolic data input to it. The models learned are used to drive a synthetic agent that can interact with the world in a semi-natural way. The system has been evaluated in the domain of table-top game playing and has been shown to be successful at learning protocol behaviours in such real-world audio-visual environments.},

@article{morse_evaluating_2000,
	Abstract = {Although visualizations are components of many information interfaces, testing of these visual elements is rarely undertaken except as a part of overall usability testing. For this reason, it is unclear what role, if any, visualizations actually perform. Our method involves the creation of simple visual prototypes and task sets based on a visual taxonomy which allows testing of the visualization in isolation from the rest of the system. By defining tests using a visual taxonomy rather than customary tasks from the application domain, our method circumvents the problems of restricting evaluation of newer more capable systems to only those tasks which might be accomplished with older, less capable ones. This paper will discuss methods for exhaustively testing the capabilities of a visualization by mapping from a domain-independent taxonomy of visual tasks to a specific domain, i.e. information retrieval. Experimental results are presented illustrating this approach to determining the role visualizations may play in supporting users in information-seeking environments. Our methods could easily be extended to other domains including data visualization.},

@article{brdiczka_detecting_2009,
	Abstract = {This paper addresses learning and recognition of human behavior models from multimodal observation in a smart home environment. The proposed approach is part of a framework for acquiring a high-level contextual model for human behavior in an augmented environment. A 3-D video tracking system creates and tracks entities (persons) in the scene. Further, a speech activity detector analyzes audio streams coming from head set microphones and determines for each entity, whether the entity speaks or not. An ambient sound detector detects noises in the environment. An individual role detector derives basic activity like ldquowalkingrdquo or ldquointeracting with tablerdquo from the extracted entity properties of the 3-D tracker. From the derived multimodal observations, different situations like ldquoaperitifrdquo or ldquopresentationrdquo are learned and detected using statistical models ({HMMs).} The objective of the proposed general framework is two-fold: the automatic offline analysis of human behavior recordings and the online detection of learned human behavior models. To evaluate the proposed approach, several multimodal recordings showing different situations have been conducted. The obtained results, in particular for offline analysis, are very good, showing that multimodality as well as multiperson observation generation are beneficial for situation recognition.},

@article{olman_classification_2004,
	Abstract = {A successful vision system must solve the problem of deriving geometrical information about three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional photometric input. The human visual system solves this problem with remarkable efficiency, and one challenge in vision research is to understand howneural representations of objects are formed and what visual information is used to form these representations. Ideal observer analysis has demonstrated the advantages of studying vision from the perspective of explicit generative models and a specified visual task, which divides the causes of image variations into the separate categories of signal and noise. Classification image techniques estimate the visual information used in a task from the properties of {\^a}noise{\^a} images that interact most strongly with the task. Both ideal observer analysis and classification image techniques rely on the assumption of a generative model. We show here how the ability of the classification image approach to understand how an observer uses visual information can be improved by matching the type and dimensionality of the model to that of the neural representation or internal template being studied. Because image variation in real world object tasks can arise from both geometrical shape and photometric (illumination or material) changes, a realistic image generation process should model geometry as well as intensity. A simple example is used to demonstrate what we refer to as a {\^a}classification object{\^a} approach to studying three-dimensional object representations.},

The studies provide a different perspective on decision strategies from laboratory studies that rely on naive subjects performing relatively context-free tasks under little time pressure and static task conditions. The field research paradigms generate a description of proficient decision making that emphasizes recognitional rather than analytical processes and challenges the decision tree representation of decision problems-that is, failure to use analytical methods is not a sign of incompetence since the recognitional strategies shown by decision makers seem reasonable and effective. Implications of these models for decision-support systems and for training are discussed},

The task, called dynamic stocks and flows, is simple and tractable enough for laboratory experiments yet exhibits many characteristics of macrocognition. A macrocognitive model was developed using a computational instantiation of recognition-primed decision making. A microcognitive model was developed using the Adaptive Control of Thought - Rational ({ACT-R)} cognitive architecture. Both models followed an instance-based learning paradigm and displayed striking similarities, including their constraints, limitations, and the key breakthrough that enabled satisfactory (though still short of human-like) performance, suggesting the emergence of a general design pattern. On the basis of this comparison we argue that although some substantive differences remain, microcognitive and macrocognitive approaches provide complementary rather than contradictory accounts of human behavior.},

@article{griffin_weighing_1992,
	Abstract = {The pattern of overconfidence and underconfidence observed in studies of intuitive judgment is explained by the hypothesis that people focus on the strength or extremeness of the available evidence (e.g., the warmth of a letter or the size of an effect) with insufficient regard for its weight or credence (e.g., the credibility of the writer or the size of the sample). This mode of judgment yields overconfidence when strength is high and weight is low, and underconfidence when strength is low and weight is high. We first demonstrate this phenomenon in a chance setup where strength is defined by sample proportion and weight is defined by sample size, and then extend the analysis to more complex evidential problems, including general knowledge questions and predicting the behavior of self and of others. We propose that people's confidence is determined by the balance of arguments for and against the competing hypotheses, with insufficient regard for the weight of the evidence. We show that this account can explain the effect of item difficulty on overconfidence, and we relate the observed discrepancy between confidence judgments and frequency estimates to the illusion of validity. Finally, we contrast the present account with a frequentistic model of confidence proposed by Gigerenzer and his colleagues, and present data that refute their model.},

@article{wen-hau_inhabitants_2008,
	Abstract = {Home automation systems should evolve to the next phase in which they are aware of contexts, because providing services based on contexts will upgrade the service quality, thus making people more comfortable and home living more convenient. In particular, location is a piece of important and useful context information for seeking appropriate services, as well as providing them to people living in a home. So far, there have been several studies focused on tracking inhabitants in smart home environments. However, these approaches are often intrusive or require inhabitants to wear some sort of devices, which may make the inhabitants uncomfortable or even inconvenient. This problem could devastate the ultimate goal, which is to provide convenient services, and hence cause such approaches somewhat controversial. In this study, we utilize a number of load sensors together to construct a sensory floor on which exerted pressure can be detected and cover its surface with wooden flooring as in a normal home environment. Although the wooden flooring provides a flat surface for inhabitants to walk on, it also causes clutter in the sensor readings, which lead to difficulty in clearly identifying the location(s) of pressure source(s). Thus, we apply probabilistic data association technique and {LeZi-Update} approach to analyze the cluttered pressure readings collected by the load sensors so as to determine the positions of the inhabitants, as well as to track their movements. With our nonintrusive approach, there is no need for inhabitants to wear any devices, and this also solves the cross-walking problem in the home environment. Note to Practitioners-This system aims for detecting the location of multiple inhabitants in the home environment. We adopt the sensory floor as our tracking sensor, which consists of many blocks, each with a load cell to collect the human body weight. These blocks are covered with conventional wooden flooring to provide a flat surface on which inhabitant- s can walk freely. After collecting data, we apply mathematical techniques to analyze them, thus determining inhabitants' locations and tracking their movements. The limitation is that the system cannot differentiate different persons if they have close weight readings, which is the natural limitation of the load cell.},

These disasters were due to the adverse conjunction of a large number of causal factors, each one necessary but singly insufficient to achieve the catastrophic outcome. Although the errors and violations of those at the immediate human-system interface often feature large in the post-accident investigations, it is evident that these `front-line' operators are rarely the principal instigators of system breakdown. Their part is often to provide just those local triggering conditions necessary to manifest systemic weaknesses created by fallible decisions made earlier in the organizational and managerial spheres. The challenge facing the human reliability community is to find ways of identifying and neutralizing these latent failures before they combine with local triggering events to breach the system's defences. New methods of risk assessment and risk management are needed if we are to achieve any significant improvements in the safety of complex, well-defended, socio-technical systems. This paper distinguishes between active and latent human failures and proposes a general framework for understanding the dynamics of accident causation. It also suggests ways in which current methods of protection may be enhanced, and concludes by discussing the unusual structural features of `high-reliability' organizations.},

	Abstract = {The Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler ({WSR-88D)} is an important operational and research tool for detecting and monitoring convective storms. Two scanning strategies, or volume coverage patterns, {VCP} 11 and 21, are used in storm situations. Users find that these original {VCPs} do not always provide the vertical or temporal resolution that is desired. To help solve these resolution problems, a procedure is proposed for developing optimized and flexible {VCPs.} A {VCP} is optimized when the maximum height uncertainty (expressed in percent of true height) is essentially the same at all ranges and for all heights of storm features. A {VCP} becomes flexible when the volume scan terminates and recycles after it tilts above all radar return or reaches a specified elevation angle. Two sample {VCPs}, which are optimized and flexible, are presented, and simulated radar data show that they perform better than the current {VCPs.}},

We take an object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel classification problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc. Finally we generate confidence-scored {3D} proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes. The system runs at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our comparison with related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton nearest neighbor matching.},

We design an intelligent workspace system that analyzes the context of a user{\^a}s tasks and generates appropriate feedback guiding the user to complete the tasks correctly. While a user is performing the high-level activity, our system analyzes what sub-events the user has already completed and what sub-events are needed next in order for the user to finish the activity. Based on this analysis, the system generates hierarchical feedback messages to assist the user. We test our system on three different types of tasks: tightening nuts on a wheel of a car, assembling a toy spaceship with {LEGO} blocks, and assembling a laptop computer with its parts. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the vision-based activity analysis, and a comparative user study shows that our system{\^a}s feedback enables users to complete assembly tasks with significantly improved efficiency.},

@article{wang_upper_????,
	Abstract = {This study evaluated the postures that workers used to perform 18 different tasks at an electric iron assembly plant by classifying the common simultaneous and individual postures of eight upper body segments and the fingers. The postures of the head, upper arms, lower arms, hand, and trunk were assigned to the categories of {{\^a}Neutral},{\^a} {{\^a}Bend},{\^a} {{\^a}Twist},{\^a} and {{\^a}Invisible.{\^a}} The finger postures were also assigned to 14 categories. Overall, most workers bent the head, lower arms, and hands and used power grips to wrap all fingers around parts and tools. The upper arms and trunk were in neutral positions because the workers stood at a conveyor belt. Among 18 tasks, the task of {\^a}setting temperature{\^a} seemed the lightest work because most body segments were in neutral positions for more than 54.6\% of a cycle time, while the task of {\^a}palletizing{\^a} seemed the most stressful work because all body segments were bent more than 54.4\% of a cycle time. These posture differences among the tasks result from the different task characteristics of workplace design, task difficulty, and work duration. It would be useful in designing workplace and evaluating physical workload. {\^A}{\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{doswell_human_1986,
	Abstract = {Weather forecasting is evolving in a world characterized by accelerating scientific and technological change. This scientific and technological change has led to some confusion and concern about the role of humans in forecasting the weather. Therefore, this essay tries to find the proper perspective for understanding how humans contribute value to the prediction process.

Scientific weather forecasting proceeds by combining a diagnosis of the atmosphere's current state with a prognosis. It is argued that the diagnostic step involves both quantitative and qualitative knowledge of the meteorology, if the maximum possible understanding is to be gained. Since machines do not have access to qualitative information, they cannot provide as complete a diagnosis as humans. Further, in humans, the diagnostic and prognostic steps are blurred, allowing qualitative knowledge to influence the forecast as well.

Many aspects of the current operational forecasting system are discussed that suggest this system is steadily disconnecting humans and their skills from the weather forecasting process. The educational system, which functions largely as a certification process for forecasters, is shown to be contributing to this erosion of roles for humans in weather forecasting. Some possible implications for the future are described, along with some alternative approaches that can reverse current trends.},

Intelligent agents have offered tremendous potential in supporting well-defined tasks such as information filtering, data mining and data conversion. However, the use of intelligent agents to support decisions has not been explored and merits serious consideration. This paper proposes a taxonomy of agent characteristics that can be used to help identify agents to support different types of decision tasks. We advocate a goal-directed, behavior-based architecture for building cooperative decision support using agents.

These are vision systems that apply reasoning and learning on different levels of abstraction and correspondingly have to deal with hypotheses from different categorical domains. Following some principles of human cognition, we present an approach to information fusion that closely couples reasoning and representation. We will discuss how processes like probabilistic contextual reasoning as well as functional and nonfunctional requirements in storing data from different sources can be integrated by a unified {XML} based data representation. Due to the interaction between active processes and data storage, we call our approach an active memory. Performance results of an implemented system as well as an evaluation of data fusion from contextual inference will be presented.},

	Abstract = {In modern manufacturing environments, vast amounts of data are collected in database management systems and data warehouses from all involved areas, including product and process design, assembly, materials planning, quality control, scheduling, maintenance, fault detection etc. Data mining has emerged as an important tool for knowledge acquisition from the manufacturing databases. This paper reviews the literature dealing with knowledge discovery and data mining applications in the broad domain of manufacturing with a special emphasis on the type of functions to be performed on the data. The major data mining functions to be performed include characterization and description, association, classification, prediction, clustering and evolution analysis. The papers reviewed have therefore been categorized in these five categories. It has been shown that there is a rapid growth in the application of data mining in the context of manufacturing processes and enterprises in the last 3 years. This review reveals the progressive applications and existing gaps identified in the context of data mining in manufacturing. A novel text mining approach has also been used on the abstracts and keywords of 150 papers to identify the research gaps and find the linkages between knowledge area, knowledge type and the applied data mining tools and techniques.},

a {J.C.} Flanagan's (1954) critical incident technique extended to include
probes that elicit aspects of expertise such as the basis for making
perceptual discriminations, conceptual discriminations, typicality
judgments, and critical cues. The method has been used to elicit domain
knowledge from experienced personnel such as urban and wildland
fireground commanders, tank platoon leaders, structural engineers,
design engineers, paramedics, and computer programmers. A model of
decision-making derived from these investigations is presented as the
theoretical background to the methodology. Instruments and procedures
for implementing the approach are described. Applications of the method
include developing expert systems, evaluating expert systems'
performance, identifying training requirements, and investigating basic

	Abstract = {Model-based qualitative icons and adaptive window display interfaces may be valuable tools to enhance the effectiveness of operators in real-time data-intensive supervisory control systems. Qualitative icons may be used to integrate low-level quantitative data into high-level qualitative error detection mechanisms. Using windowing technology, multiple data sources that reflect different aspects of system state can be displayed simultaneously on a single screen. Both technologies were combined and implemented to design an operator interface to the Georgia Tech-Multisatellite Operation Control Center ({GT-MSOCC).} An operator function model for {GT-MSOCC} was used to derive workstation features, including hardware configuration, the function of qualitative icons for monitoring, fault detection and identification, and the contents and placement of computer windows. The model also determined sets of windows needed by the operator to undertake major operator control functions. An experiment was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a workstation incorporating model-based qualitative icons and dynamic operator function window sets. Subjects controlled {GT-MSOCC} via either a conventional operator interface or the model-based interface. Eleven measures that reflected operator performance were analyzed. Subjects using the model-based workstation operated the system significantly better on nine of these measures. On all measures, performance with the model-based workstation was uniformly better on average and had less variability than performance with the conventional workstation.},

@article{carneiro_supervised_2007,
	Abstract = {A probabilistic formulation for semantic image annotation and retrieval is proposed. Annotation and retrieval are posed as classification problems where each class is defined as the group of database images labeled with a common semantic label. It is shown that, by establishing this one-to-one correspondence between semantic labels and semantic classes, a minimum probability of error annotation and retrieval are feasible with algorithms that are 1) conceptually simple, 2) computationally efficient, and 3) do not require prior semantic segmentation of training images. In particular, images are represented as bags of localized feature vectors, a mixture density estimated for each image, and the mixtures associated with all images annotated with a common semantic label pooled into a density estimate for the corresponding semantic class. This pooling is justified by a multiple instance learning argument and performed efficiently with a hierarchical extension of expectation-maximization. The benefits of the supervised formulation over the more complex, and currently popular, joint modeling of semantic label and visual feature distributions are illustrated through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments. The supervised formulation is shown to achieve higher accuracy than various previously published methods at a fraction of their computational cost. Finally, the proposed method is shown to be fairly robust to parameter tuning},

@article{kushniruk_cognitive_2004,
	Abstract = {Increasingly healthcare policy and decision makers are demanding evidence to justify investments in health information systems. This demand requires an adequate evaluation of these systems. A wide variety of approaches and methodologies have been applied in assessing the impact of information systems in health care, ranging from controlled clinical trials to use of questionnaires and interviews with users. In this paper we describe methodological approaches which we have applied and refined for the past 10 years for the evaluation of health information systems. The approaches are strongly rooted in theories and methods from cognitive science and the emerging field of usability engineering. The focus is on assessing human computer interaction and in particular, the usability of computer systems in both laboratory and naturalistic settings. The methods described can be a part of the formative evaluation of systems during their iterative development, and can also complement more traditional assessment methods used in summative system evaluation of completed systems. The paper provides a review of the general area of systems evaluation with the motivation and rationale for methodological approaches underlying usability engineering and cognitive task analysis as applied to health information systems. This is followed by a detailed description of the methods we have applied in a variety of settings in conducting usability testing and usability inspection of systems such as computer-based patient records. Emerging trends in the evaluation of complex information systems are discussed.},

@article{ryoo_semantic_2009,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a methodology for automated recognition of complex human activities. The paper proposes a general framework which reliably recognizes high-level human actions and human-human interactions. Our approach is a description-based approach, which enables a user to encode the structure of a high-level human activity as a formal representation. Recognition of human activities is done by semantically matching constructed representations with actual observations. The methodology uses a context-free grammar ({CFG)} based representation scheme as a formal syntax for representing composite activities. Our {CFG-based} representation enables us to define complex human activities based on simpler activities or movements. Our system takes advantage of both statistical recognition techniques from computer vision and knowledge representation concepts from traditional artificial intelligence. In the low-level of the system, image sequences are processed to extract poses and gestures. Based on the recognition of gestures, the high-level of the system hierarchically recognizes composite actions and interactions occurring in a sequence of image frames. The concept of hallucinations and a probabilistic semantic-level recognition algorithm is introduced to cope with imperfect lower-layers. As a result, the system recognizes human activities including {\^a}fighting{\^a} and {\^a}assault{\^a}, which are high-level activities that previous systems had difficulties. The experimental results show that our system reliably recognizes sequences of complex human activities with a high recognition rate.},

Algorithms are categorized based on the assumptions they make about the data being visualized; we call this set of assumptions the design model. Because our taxonomy is based on design models, it is more flexible than existing taxonomies and considers the user's conceptual model, emphasizing the human aspect of visualization. Design models are classified according to whether they are discrete or continuous and by how much the algorithm designer chooses display attributes such as spatialization, timing, colour, and transparency. This novel approach provides an alternative view of the visualization field that helps explain how traditional divisions (e.g., information and scientific visualization) relates and overlap, and that may inspire research ideas in hybrid visualization areas},

The vigilance required of human observers when engaged in such tasks must remain constant, yet attention falls off dramatically over time. In this paper we propose an automated system to monitor video sensors and tag aberrant human activities for immediate review by human monitors. From the psychological perspective, isolated human motion depicted by point-light walker ({PLW)} displays have been shown to be salient for recognition of action [17] and determination of emotional state [18]. We propose that by using the motion data that immediately precedes hostile behavior, it may be possible to classify hostile intent before destructive actions take place. These hostile intent gestures can be used to assign individuals a threat assessment level and improve remote sensor monitoring. Such assessments are useful for monitoring human activities and could potentially provide early warning of {lED} emplacement activities.},

@article{corfidi_birth_1999,
	Abstract = {An overview of the birth and development of the National Weather Service{\^a}s Storm Prediction Center, formerly known as the National Severe Storms Forecast Center, is presented. While the center{\^a}s immediate history dates to the middle of the twentieth century, the nation{\^a}s first centralized severe weather forecast effort actually appeared much earlier with the pioneering work of Army Signal Corps officer J. P. Finley in the 1870s. Little progress was made in the understanding or forecasting of severe convective weather after Finley until the nascent aviation industry fostered an interest in meteorology in the 1920s. Despite the increased attention, forecasts for tornadoes remained a rarity until Air Force forecasters E. J. Fawbush and R. C. Miller gained notoriety by correctly forecasting the second tornado to strike Tinker Air Force Base in one week on 25 March 1948. The success of this and later Fawbush and Miller efforts led the Weather Bureau (predecessor to the National Weather Service) to establish its own severe weather unit on a temporary basis in the Weather {Bureau{\^a}Army{\^a}Navy} ({WBAN)} Analysis Center Washington, {D.C.}, in March 1952. The {WBAN} severe weather unit became a permanent, five-man operation under the direction of K. M. Barnett on 21 May 1952. The group was responsible for the issuance of {\^a}bulletins{\^a} (watches) for tornadoes, high winds, and/or damaging hail; outlooks for severe convective weather were inaugurated in January 1953. An unusually large number of strong tornadoes, forecaster inexperience, and criticism regarding the unit{\^a}s products culminated in staff and policy changes after it was renamed the Severe Local Storms Warning Service ({SELS)} in June 1953. {SELS} moved from Washington to Kansas City in September 1954 in part to be closer to {\^a}tornado alley{\^a} and to take advantage of existing nationwide teletype communication facilities. The unit also gained a new leader when D. C. House replaced Barnett as {SELS} chief early that year. House instituted changes that led to more accurate watches. He also fostered the development of a separate research and development unit, an effort which had been initiated by Barnett. {SELS} continued to grow as additional forecast and support staff were added through the remainder of the 1950s and 1960s. It was renamed the National Severe Storms Forecast Center ({NSSFC)} upon relocation to a new facility and the assumption of local and regional forecast duties in 1966. Meanwhile, the research group to which {SELS} had given birth in the mid-1950s left Kansas City and merged with the Weather Bureau{\^a}s Weather Radar Laboratory to form the National Severe Storms Laboratory ({NSSL)} in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1964. {SELS}, renamed the Storm Prediction Center, joined {NSSL} in Norman in January 1997.},

@article{lohrenz_model_2009,
	Abstract = {Objective: A novel model of measuring clutter in complex geospatial displays was compared with human ratings of subjective clutter as a measure of convergent validity. The new model is called the color-clustering clutter (C3) model. Background: Clutter is a known problem in displays of complex data and has been shown to affect target search performance. Previous clutter models are discussed and compared with the C3 model. Method: Two experiments were performed. In Experiment 1, participants performed subjective clutter ratings on six classes of information visualizations. Empirical results were used to set two free parameters in the model. In Experiment 2, participants performed subjective clutter ratings on aeronautical charts. Both experiments compared and correlated empirical data to model predictions. Results: The first experiment resulted in a .76 correlation between ratings and C3. The second experiment resulted in a .86 correlation, significantly better than results from a model developed by Rosenholtz et al. Outliers to our correlation suggest further improvements to C3. Conclusions: We suggest that (a) the C3 model is a good predictor of subjective impressions of clutter in geospatial displays, (b) geospatial clutter is a function of color density and saliency (primary C3 components), and (c) pattern analysis techniques could further improve C3. Application: The C3 model could be used to improve the design of electronic geospatial displays by suggesting when a display will be too cluttered for its intended audience.},

Given the proliferation of new graphics display capabilities (e.g., overlays, animation, the combination of statistical models or numerical fields with satellite images, etc.) and new information sources (e.g., Doppler radar, wind profilers, etc.), the challenge of using color effectively without interfering with users{\^a} abilities to interact with these systems has never been greater. Psychological and ergonomic research on the perception and interpretation of colored graphical displays is reviewed not only to ferret out recommendations but to disclose the design issues raised for meteorology. In addition to relying on tradition and consensus on meteorological symbology and the use of color, an iterative empirical strategy is recommended to help establish whether candidate color schemes could result in interpretation problems when applied to actual meteorological data.},

	Note = {The recent explosion of sensing capability has influenced many domains such as medical care, public safety, and national defense. Along with the new capabilities have come new opportunities for providing tele-medicine at a distance, providing surveillance of a large physical area, and to perform reconnaissance in hostile environments. In many, if not all, of these systems performance has not kept up with the perceived opportunities these capabilities embody. Instead, generic challenges have emerged that appear fundamental to human-sensor systems. One such challenge, the multiple feeds problem, refers to the difficulty or inability of human-sensor system users and decision makers to integrate the diversity of sensor feeds that have been instantiated through these sensor systems. This challenge emerges from the lack of adequate system design for the coordination of the multiple perspectives these sensor systems represent. The Perspective Control approach addresses the multiple feeds problem through Perspective Control; a method of controlling point-of-view. In the Perspective Control approach, sensors are considered generic points-of-observation that conform to a spherical coordinate system. A user is able to control a sensor by expressing a desired view direction through a novel input device called a Perspective Controller, which also embodies a spherical coordinate system. This device not only provides a method for controlling a single sensor, but also a method for navigating between sensors. In navigating between sensors the layout of the sensor network is perceived directly (i.e., a form of extending perception). The ability of Perspective Control to solve the multiple feeds problem is established through an operational engineering demonstration that utilizes user controlled viewpoint to control a network of video cameras. This demonstration is embedded in a video surveillance context utilizing a network of pan and tilt capable video cameras. At the heart of the Perspective Control engineering demonstration is the Perspective Control apparatus which is a working prototype designed and built based on constraints of a generic point-of-observation. In addition to the Perspective Controller the engineering demonstration leverages an indoor, video camera surveillance network and a 3-dimensional virtual environment. Perspective Control is one potential approach for solving the multiple feeds problem.},

@article{yaniv_using_2007,
	Abstract = {How might people revise their opinions on the basis of multiple pieces of advice? What sort of gains could be obtained from rules for using advice? In the present studies judges first provided their initial estimates for a series of questions; next they were presented with several (2, 4, or 8) opinions from an ecological pool of advisory estimates (Experiment 1), or with artificial advice (Experiment 2); finally they provided their revised estimates. Descriptive analyses of their revision process revealed that they egocentrically trimmed the opinion sets such that opinions distant from their own were greatly discounted. Normative analyses suggest that they gained substantially from the use of advice, though not optimally, due to their self-centered utilization of the advice. The results are discussed in connection with theories of belief revision and attitude change, with an emphasis on decision-makers' strategies for coping with conflicting opinions and the appropriateness of discounting distant or dissenting opinions. Prescriptive implications for the utilization of advice are also considered.},

	Abstract = {Formal methods are typically used in the analysis of complex system components that can be described as {\^a}automated{\^a} (digital circuits, devices, protocols, and software). Human{\^a}automation interaction has been linked to system failure, where problems stem from human operators interacting with an automated system via its controls and information displays. As part of the process of designing and analyzing human{\^a}automation interaction, human factors engineers use task analytic models to capture the descriptive and normative human operator behavior. In order to support the integration of task analyses into the formal verification of larger system models, we have developed the enhanced operator function model ({EOFM)} as an Extensible Markup Language-based, platform- and analysis-independent language for describing task analytic models. We present the formal syntax and semantics of the {EOFM} and an automated process for translating an instantiated {EOFM} into the model checking language Symbolic Analysis Laboratory. We present an evaluation of the scalability of the translation algorithm. We then present an automobile cruise control example to illustrate how an instantiated {EOFM} can be integrated into a larger system model that includes environmental features and the human operator's mission. The system model is verified using model checking in order to analyze a potentially hazardous situation related to the human{\^a}automation interaction.},

@article{gray_real-time_1975,
	Abstract = {Color enhancement of images has become a powerful tool in rapid evaluation of grey-scale information. Recent advances in semiconductor technology have made possible the construction of an inexpensive digital real-time color-enhanced (or false-color) display for meteorological radar information such as reflectivity and Doppler velocities. Variable magnification allows detailed analysis of selected areas of the radar coverage. The display was interfaced to a Doppler/reflectivity processor on the {NRRE} S-band radar at Grover, Colorado, during the 1974 hail season. A preliminary meteorological analysis of the Doppler color displays of the storm of 7 August 1974 demonstrates a large variety of significant features which may be observed either in real-time or subsequently. These include the regions of convergence and vorticity, major inflow and outflow regions, and turbulence. Most importantly, it is shown that the updraft cores can he identified with the easterly-momentum air which has been transported upward with the drafts from the lower levels. In view of the slow eastward motion of the storm, the very large Doppler components found at the leading edge of the higher-level echo pattern also indicate rapid evaporation of the particles as they move out into the dear, dry environmental air. It is the resulting evaporative cooling which is responsible for the downdrafts in this vicinity. Among the many real-time applications of the color Doppler display, perhaps the most important in the artificial modification of convective storms is the location of the major inflow and updraft regions. These determine where seeding should be focused. The use of the color display also permits the ready discrimination of storm echoes from ground clutter in which they are frequently obscured. Its applicability to the detection of tornado cyclones and hurricane velocity mapping is also self-evident.},

@inproceedings{duong_activity_2005,
	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of learning and recognizing human activities of daily living ({ADL)}, which is an important research issue in building a pervasive and smart environment. In dealing with {ADL}, we argue that it is beneficial to exploit both the inherent hierarchical organization of the activities and their typical duration. To this end, we introduce the switching hidden semi-markov model (S-{HSMM)}, a two-layered extension of the hidden semi-Markov model ({HSMM)} for the modeling task. Activities are modeled in the S-{HSMM} in two ways: the bottom layer represents atomic activities and their duration using {HSMMs;} the top layer represents a sequence of high-level activities where each high-level activity is made of a sequence of atomic activities. We consider two methods for modeling duration: the classic explicit duration model using multinomial distribution, and the novel use of the discrete Coxian distribution. In addition, we propose an effective scheme to detect abnormality without the need for training on abnormal data. Experimental results show that the S-{HSMM} performs better than existing models including the flat {HSMM} and the hierarchical hidden Markov model in both classification and abnormality detection tasks, alleviating the need for presegmented training data. Furthermore, our discrete Coxian duration model yields better computation time and generalization error than the classic explicit duration model.},

@article{trapp_radar_2000,
	Abstract = {The spherical geometry of weather radar scans results in a data distribution wherein datapoint separation in one coordinate direction and/or in one part of the analysis domain can differ widely from that in another. Objective analysis of the nonuniform radar data to a uniform Cartesian grid is desirable for many diagnostic purposes. For the benefit of the diagnostic data analyst as well as of users of these analyses, the authors evaluate properties of techniques typically used for such objective analysis. This is done partly through theoretical consideration of the properties of the schemes, but mostly by empirical testing. In terms of preservation of the phase and amplitude of the input data, predictability of the degree of smoothing and filtering, and relative insensitivity to input data unsteadiness or spatial characteristic, the isotropic Gaussian or Barnes-type weight function with constant smoothing parameter appears to be the most desirable of the schemes considered. Modification of this scheme so that the weight function varies spatially, with the datapoint spacing, results in an improved analysis, according to some commonly used measures of error. Interpretation of analyses based on such a modified scheme can be affected, however. For example, analyses of unsteady input fields suffer from a convolution of the temporal evolution of the data with spatial variations of the weight function. As a consequence, unambiguous assessment of physical evolution is precluded.},

This paper will illuminate impacts of the recent infusion of technology into the forecast environment which produced significant benefits, yet important challenges for decision makers to overcome.

@article{zacks_perceiving_2001,
	Abstract = {How do people perceive routine events, such as making a bed, as these events unfold in time? Research on knowledge structures suggests that people conceive of events as goal-directed partonomic hierarchies. Here, participants segmented videos of events into coarse and fine units on separate viewings; some described the activity of each unit as well. Both segmentation and descriptions support the hierarchical bias hypothesis in event perception: Observers spontaneously encoded the events in terms of partonomic hierarchies. Hierarchical organization was strengthened by simultaneous description and, to a weaker extent, by familiarity. Describing from memory rather than perception yielded fewer units but did not alter the qualitative nature of the descriptions. Although the descriptions were telegraphic and without communicative intent, their hierarchical structure was evident to naive readers. The data suggest that cognitive schemata mediate between perceptual and functional information about events and indicate that these knowledge structures may be organized around object/action units.},

	Abstract = {Human activity recognition is an important area of computer vision research. Its applications include surveillance systems, patient monitoring systems, and a variety of systems that involve interactions between persons and electronic devices such as human-computer interfaces. Most of these applications require an automated recognition of high-level activities, composed of multiple simple (or atomic) actions of persons. This article provides a detailed overview of various state-of-the-art research papers on human activity recognition. We discuss both the methodologies developed for simple human actions and those for high-level activities. An approach-based taxonomy is chosen that compares the advantages and limitations of each approach. Recognition methodologies for an analysis of the simple actions of a single person are first presented in the article. Space-time volume approaches and sequential approaches that represent and recognize activities directly from input images are discussed. Next, hierarchical recognition methodologies for high-level activities are presented and compared. Statistical approaches, syntactic approaches, and description-based approaches for hierarchical recognition are discussed in the article. In addition, we further discuss the papers on the recognition of human-object interactions and group activities. Public datasets designed for the evaluation of the recognition methodologies are illustrated in our article as well, comparing the methodologies' performances. This review will provide the impetus for future research in more productive areas.},

@techreport{fischhoff_subjective_1981,
	Abstract = {To be useful, a forecast must not only predict the future, but also give some indication of how much confidence to place in that prediction. The appropriateness of people's confidence in their general knowledge has been studied extensively. After briefly reviewing that literature, the present article attempts to make it more directly relevant to forecasters by repeating previous studies in the context of confidence in forecasts. The most robust of previous results was strongly replicated: Participants were greatly overconfident in their predictions when dealing with a fairly hard-to-predict set of events. A procedure that had previously proved effective in reducing overconfidence, forcing respondents to provide reasons why their answers might be wrong, was of minor value here. A new result was the discovery of a simple indicator of the quality of people's confidence assessments, whether they ever expressed certitude. Possible implications of these results for producing and using forecasts are discussed. (Author)},

@article{parasuraman_fuzzy_2000,
	Abstract = {Signal detection theory ({SDT)} assumes a Division of Objective truths of {"States} of the World" into the nonoverlapping categories of signal and noise. The definition of a signal in many real settings, however, varies with context and over time. In the terminology of fuzzy logic, a real-world signal has a value that falls in a range between unequivocal presence and unequivocal absence. The definition of a response can also be nonbinary. Accordingly the methods of fuzzy logic can be combined with {SDT}, yielding fuzzy {SDT.} We describe the basic postulates of fuzzy {SDT} and provide formulas for fuzzy analysis of detection performance, based on four steps: (a) selection of mapping functions for signal and response; (b) use of mixed-implication functions to assign degrees of membership in hits, false alarms, misses, and correct rejections; (c) computation of fuzzy hit, false alarm, miss, and correct rejection rates; and (d) computation of fuzzy sensitivity and bias measures. Fuzzy {SDT} can considerably extend the range and utility of {SDT} by handling the contextual and temporal variability of most real-world signals. Actual or potential applications of fuzzy {SDT} include evaluation of the performance of human, machine, and human-machine detectors in real systems.},

	Abstract = {We present a top-down approach to simultaneously track and recognize articulated full-body human motion using learned action models that is robust to variations in style, lighting, background,occlusion and viewpoint. To this end, we introduce the hierarchical variable transition hidden Markov model ({HVT-HMM)} that is a three-layered extension of the variable transition hidden Markov model ({VTHMM).} The top-most layer of the {HVT-HMM} represents the composite actions and contains a single Markov chain, the middle layer represents the primitive actions which are modeled using a {VTHMM} whose state transition probability varies with time and the bottom-most layer represents the body pose transitions using a {HMM.} We represent the pose using a {23D} body model and present efficient learning and decoding algorithms for {HVT-HMM.} Further, in classical Viterbi decoding the entire sequence must be seen before the state at any instant can be recognized and hence can potentially have large latency for long video sequences. In order to address this we use a variable window approach to decoding with very low latency. We demonstrate our methods first in a domain for recognizing two-handed gestures and then in a domain with actions involving articulated motion of the entire body. Our approach shows 90-100\% action recognition in both domains and runs at real-time (ap 30 fps) with very low average latency (ap 2 frames).},

	Abstract = {We outline a model for types and levels of automation that
provides a framework and an objective basis for deciding which system
functions should be automated and to what extent. Appropriate selection
is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes
human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human
operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad
classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information
analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action
implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied
across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual
to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all
four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of
particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative
criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative
criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action
consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of
automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to
automation design},

In order to assess the economic value of the forecasts a value index is suggested that takes into account the cost-loss ratio and forecast errors.

@article{yu_hidden_2003,
	Abstract = {A hidden Markov model ({HMM)} encompasses a large class of stochastic process models and has been successfully applied to a number of scientific and engineering problems, including speech and other pattern recognition problems, and {DNA} sequence comparison. A hidden semi-Markov model ({HSMM)} is an extension of {HMM}, designed to remove the constant or geometric distributions of the state durations assumed in {HMM.} A larger class of practical problems can be appropriately modeled in the setting of {HSMM.} A major restriction is found, however, in both conventional {HMM} and {HSMM}, i.e., it is generally assumed that there exists at least one observation associated with every state that the hidden Markov chain takes on. We will remove this assumption and consider the following situations: (i) observation data may be missing for some intervals; and (ii) there are multiple observation streams that are not necessarily synchronous to each other and may have different {\^a}emission distributions{\^a} for the same state. We propose a new and computationally efficient forward{\^a}backward algorithm for {HSMM} with missing observations and multiple observation sequences. The required computational amount for the forward and backward variables is reduced to O(D), where D is the maximum allowed duration in a state. Finally, we will apply the extended {HSMM} to estimate the mobility model parameters for the Internet service provisioning in wireless networks.},

@article{beach_subjective_1969,
	Abstract = {In 4 experiments subjective probability estimates and confidence ratings were obtained to see if they are equivalent measures of undergraduate Ss' opinions about uncertain events. In the 1st 2 studies, Ss made estimates and then rated their confidence in the accuracy of the estimates. Ratings were high for extreme estimates, low near the point of "equiprobability," and were uninfluenced by additional information about the events. Ratings appeared to be merely a transform on the estimates, to which they added little information. In the last 2 studies, ratings and estimates were used as alternative measures in an opinion revision task. Both measures yielded the same results. (16 ref.)

	Abstract = {This paper begins with a discussion of the perceived requirement for general psychological models to underpin the design of human interaction with complex systems. A proposal is made that general psychological models may not be necessary, if indeed possible to create, for many applications of interest. For the applications of interest, cognitive engineering or human-machine systems models, such as the operator function model ({OFM)}, may suffice. Next, a brief overview of the current state of {OFM} and its computational implementation, {OFMspert}, is presented. It describes how {OFMspert} has been extended to support the design of two intelligent tutoring systems ({ITS)} for operational control of safety-critical systems. An intelligent tutoring system requires two models: an expert model and a student model. This paper describes how the {OFM} can serve as the basis of the expert model and the {OFMspert} architecture as the basis for the architecture of the tutor itself},

@inproceedings{guerlain_visualizing_2000,
	Abstract = {One common problem with information displays, particularly in process control, is that relevant data is often scattered across several, separate displays that obscure important relationships and fail to show event information. The current displays used for model-based predictive controllers demonstrate several of the problems that this kind of a design can incur. It is hard to get a good sense of the recent, current and near-future status of the controller (situation awareness), and it is difficult to make informed decision when making changes to the controller (putting data into context). This forces users to navigate around a virtual workspace and attempt to compile the data necessary to make an informed conclusion. We have applied several design principles to show how it is possible to re-represent data into hierarchical data layers that support the cognitive tasks of monitoring, diagnosis, and control. This design forms a coherent, coordinated workspace which helps orient users to problems in the controller, with direct navigation to supporting details.},

@article{heinselman_rapid_2008,
	Abstract = {A key advantage of the National Weather Radar Testbed Phased Array Radar ({PAR)} is the capability to adaptively scan storms at higher temporal resolution than is possible with the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler ({WSR-88D):} 1 min or less versus 4.1 min, respectively. High temporal resolution volumetric radar data are a necessity for rapid identification and confirmation of weather phenomena that can develop within minutes. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the {PAR{\^a}s} ability to collect rapid-scan volumetric data that provide more detailed depictions of quickly evolving storm structures than the {WSR-88D.} Scientific advantages of higher temporal resolution {PAR} data are examined for three convective storms that occurred during the spring and summer of 2006, including a reintensifying supercell, a microburst, and a hailstorm. The analysis of the reintensifying supercell (58-s updates) illustrates the capability to diagnose the detailed evolution of developing and/or intensifying areas of 1) low-altitude divergence and rotation and 2) rotation through the depth of the storm. The fuller sampling of the microburst{\^a}s storm life cycle (34-s updates) depicts precursors to the strong surface outflow that are essentially indiscernible in the {WSR-88D} data. Furthermore, the 34-s scans provide a more precise sampling of peak outflow. The more frequent sampling of the hailstorm (26-s updates) illustrates the opportunity to analyze storm structures indicative of rapid intensification, the development of hail aloft, and the onset of the downdraft near the surface.},

	Abstract = {This work investigates the problem of robust, longterm visual tracking of unknown objects in unconstrained environments. It therefore must cope with frame-cuts, fast camera movements and partial/total object occlusions/dissapearances. We propose a new approach, called Tracking-Modeling-Detection ({TMD)} that closely integrates adaptive tracking with online learning of the object-specific detector. Starting from a single click in the first frame, {TMD} tracks the selected object by an adaptive tracker. The trajectory is observed by two processes (growing and pruning event) that robustly model the appearance and build an object detector on the fly. Both events make errors, the stability of the system is achieved by their cancellation. The learnt detector enables re-initialization of the tracker whenever previously observed appearance reoccurs. We show the real-time learning and classification is achievable with random forests. The performance and the long-term stability of {TMD} is demonstrated and evaluated on a set of challenging video sequences with various objects such as cars, people and animals.},

This work introduces a descriptive decision-making model of emergency management during the four severe weather phases: Pre-Storm, Severe Weather Watch, Severe Weather Warning, and Severe Weather Event. The initial model describes {EMs'} use of information and their decisions made. Eleven emergency managers participated in three questionnaires and two part-task simulated weather scenarios based on archived weather data. This work then refines the Severe Weather Warning phase of the model by validating the entries and adding data concerning the role of the information and precursors to decisions made and actions taken. The scenarios also highlight problems that {EMs} have with interpreting velocity data and with integrating data from multiple radar sources. These results will impact {CASA} system visualization design and training.},

@article{gopher_psychophysics_1984,
	Abstract = {Psychophysical functions describe the relationship between variations in the amplitude of a defined physical quantity and the psychological perception of these changes. Examples are brightness, loudness, and pain. The regularities of these relationships have been formulated into psychophysical laws. The measurement methodology of psychophysical scaling has been refined by the Harvard group led by S. S. Stevens, who proposed a power function as a general form for such laws. The main argument of the present article is that a similar scaling approach can be adapted to the measurement of workload and task demands based upon subjective estimates. The rationale is that these estimates, like other psychophysical judgments, reflect the individual's perception of the amount of processing resources that the subject invests to meet the demand imposed by a task. This approach was successfully applied to the assessment of 21 experimental conditions given to a group of 60 subjects. The paper discusses the main results of this effort and their implications to theory and application in human performance.},

Called {OFMspert} (operator function model ({OFM)} expert system), the architecture uses the operator function modeling methodology as the basis for the design. The authors put emphasis on the understanding capabilities, i.e. the intent referencing property, of an operator's associate. They define the generic structure of {OFMspert}, particularly those features that support intent inferencing. They also describe the implementation and validation of {OFMspert} in {GT-MSOCC} (Georgia Tech-Multisatellite Operations Control Center), a laboratory domain designed to support research in human-computer interaction and decision aiding in complex, dynamic systems},

@article{nadav-greenberg_uncertainty_2009,
	Abstract = {The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of weather uncertainty information on decision making in naturalistic settings. Traditional research often reveals deficits in human decision making under uncertainty as compared with normative models of rational choice. However, little research has addressed the question of whether people in naturalistic settings make better decisions when they have uncertainty information as compared with when they have only a deterministic forecast. Two studies investigated the effect of several types of weather uncertainty information on the quality of decisions to protect roads against icing and on temperature predictions and compared them with a control condition that provided deterministic forecast only. Experiment 1 was a Web-based questionnaire that included a single trial. Experiment 2, conducted in lab, included 120 trials and provided outcome feedback and a reward based on performance. Both studies indicated enhanced performance with uncertainty information. The best kind of uncertainty information tested here was the one that provided the probability at the threshold for the task at hand. We conclude that uncertainty information can be used advantageously, even when it does not result in perfectly rational performance, and that uncertainty can be communicated effectively to nonexpert end users, resulting in improved decision making.},

@article{gerling_design_2009,
	Abstract = {The most effective screening for prostate cancer combines the prostate specific antigen blood test with the digital rectal examination ({DRE).} In performing a {DRE}, two sequential tasks are completed: ( task a) palpating the prostate to identify abnormalities and ( task b) linking identified abnormalities to a disease diagnosis. At present, clinicians find too few abnormalities and have variable rates of detection, due in part to the inadequacy of training simulators. The Virginia Prostate Examination Simulator ({VPES)} was designed, built, and tested to address the inadequacies of current simulators by incorporating the design requirements of the basic elements of accurate anatomy, multiple and reconfigurable scenarios of graded difficulty, and technique and performance feedback. We compared the training effectiveness of the {VPES} with two commercial simulators in an experiment of 36 medical and nurse practitioner students. Results indicate each type of training simulator-improved abilities, in general. Upon closer analysis, however, the following key patterns emerge: 1) Across all types of training, more deficiencies lie in skill-based rather than rule-based decision making, which improves only for {VPES} trainees; 2) only {VPES} training transfers both to other simulators and previously unencountered scenarios; 3) visual feedback may increase the number of abnormalities reported yet hinder the ability to discriminate; and 4) applied finger pressure did not correlate with the ability to identify abnormalities.},

@article{morss_communicating_2008,
	Abstract = {Weather forecasts are inherently uncertain, and meteorologists have information about weather forecast uncertainty that is not readily available to most forecast users. Yet effectively communicating forecast uncertainty to nonmeteorologists remains challenging. Improving forecast uncertainty communication requires research-based knowledge that can inform decisions on what uncertainty information to communicate, when, and how to do so. To help build such knowledge, this article explores the public{\^a}s perspectives on everyday weather forecast uncertainty and uncertainty information using results from a nationwide survey. By contributing to the fundamental understanding of laypeople{\^a}s views on forecast uncertainty, the findings can inform both uncertainty communication and related {research.The} article uses empirical data from a nationwide survey of the {U.S.} public to investigate beliefs commonly held among meteorologists and to explore new topics. The results show that when given a deterministic temperature forecast, most respondents expected the temperature to fall within a range around the predicted value. In other words, most people inferred uncertainty into the deterministic forecast. People{\^a}s preferences for deterministic versus nondeterministic forecasts were examined in two situations; in both, a significant majority of respondents liked weather forecasts that expressed uncertainty, and many preferred such forecasts to single-valued forecasts. The article also discusses people{\^a}s confidence in different types of forecasts, their interpretations of the probability of precipitation forecasts, and their preferences for how forecast uncertainty is conveyed. Further empirical research is needed to study the article{\^a}s findings in other contexts and to continue exploring perception, interpretation, communication, and use of weather forecast uncertainty.},

@phdthesis{wrede_information-driven_2008,
	Abstract = {With computer science more and more leaving the traits of solitary algorithms and distinct disciplines towards complex intelligent and integrated systems, challenging research questions are in reach to be explored in novel application scenarios. Under the term "cognitive systems" and its subfields of "cognitive robotics" and "cognitive vision", research recently made a significant leap forward regarding these challenges. Experimental cognitive systems research is thus characterized by a flexible composition of different algorithms and the development of interdisciplinary models for artificial cognition. Integrated cognitive systems allow us to address scientific questions that go far beyond what can be achieved with solitary algorithms. For example, such systems include personal robot "companions" or assistance systems that are embedded in the world and permit interaction with humans and their environment. Integrated cognitive systems allow us to test hypothetical models of cognition in the "real" world. Owing to the innate complexity of these systems, questions of software integration and software architecture have become research activities in their own right. Consequently, topics and methods known from software and systems engineering need to be adopted for research on experimental cognitive systems. This thesis addresses the questions how the complexity in software architectures for cognitive systems can be reduced and how joint integration in large-scale research projects can be facilitated. It approaches these questions from three viewpoints: the functional, collaborative, and engineering viewpoint. Acknowledging their importance leads to the design of a coherent and comprehensive architectural concept that is introduced with this dissertation. This approach fuses paradigms of event-driven and service-oriented architectures with domain-specific support for cognitive systems, yielding a novel concept: information-driven integration. The resulting software architecture facilitates joint development and integration by providing on the one hand good support for the functional requirements of experimental cognitive systems and on the other hand by explicitly considering the peculiarities of research environments as integration contexts. The application of the information-driven integration architecture in various cognitive systems projects is presented as strong evidence for the appropriateness of its design and implementation. This thesis bridges the gap between single algorithms and their respective component developers on the one side, and system integration and evaluation on the other by means of a novel integrating approach supporting the collaborative construction of experimental cognitive systems.},

Inference and learning are efficiently addressed by providing a graphical representation for the model in terms of a dynamic Bayesian network ({DBN).} We investigate both discrete and continuous distributions from the exponential family (Poisson and inverse Gaussian respectively) for the problem of learning and recognizing {ADLs.} A full comparison between the exponential family duration models and other existing models including the traditional multinomial and the new Coxian are also presented.

	Abstract = {How to design and to evaluate adaptive distributed sensor networks with respect to end user decision making is an important topic in human-automation interaction. This study evaluates four resource allocation strategies (static automation, adaptive sensing, mixed-initiative control, and control incorporating end user task analytic information) in a simulated prototype weather sensor network. Performance of each sensor network resource allocation strategy was assessed with measures of sensor coverage quality over a target geographic region of interest. Coverage measures calculated from the number of radar nodes, tilts and cycles were derived for partial (radar scan touches at least part of the analysis region) and complete coverage of the region by single and multiple (two or more) radars. Single and multi-radar coverage area scores were also derived from the cumulative fraction of the analysis regions area that was scanned. Using three weather scenarios, results show that static automation significantly outperforms the other strategies in all cases using measures of single and multi-radar complete coverage and for a uniformly distributed weather event using single and multi-radar coverage scores. Otherwise the three strategies outperform static automation. As the performance of resource allocation strategies are sensitive to the weather events themselves as well as the measures used to evaluate them, the design of next generation of algorithms should consider these performance distinctions.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a modeling method of human motion for the purpose of constructing a human body/structure/motion database. Various representation methods of the human body and of its motions are used in Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality, etc. Furthermore, measuring and analyzing methods of human motion using for instance {3D} digitizers, high resolution video cameras are presented in many fields such as rehabilitation, ergonomic design and production planning. Besides, many new applications that can analyze the human motion from a medical point of view are available. In the future of these fields, we consider that a database system which can manage various human data and support flexible query operations is needed. In order to compare a new captured human body/structure/motion data with another human data in a computer system, the data need to be unified and to correspond to semantics. We focused on the modeling of human motion by including an example motion, describing its actual motion and semantically associating the example with the motion. In fact, in a previous work, we defined the concept of Hub which represents an example motion. We also defined the concept of Mediator which not only represents the individual motion characteristics but also associates the Hub with the real human motion data detected from multimedia such as videos. To extend our previous work, we now consider the notion of order in the sequences of the human motion. In that we introduce the concepts of Atomic Unit and Motion Graph. These concepts allow us to analyze human motions and to compare their sequences. Indeed they are a good way to unify data from various applications.},

Contributions include the development of a perceptually correlated metric that is useful for quantifying the salience of local, low-level visual cues and identifying those spatial frequencies that are most distinct and perhaps most relied upon by radiologists for decision making. A set of 40 mammograms and registered eye position data from nine observers was used to evaluate the salience metric. A parsimonious analysis-of-variance model explained the variance in the salience results. This analysis is generalized to a population of readers and cases. An analysis of salience versus time of first eye fixation shows good correlation with true positive lesions that were found by experienced readers in less than 2 s.},

@article{bauckhage_visual_2008,
	Abstract = {Object recognition is the ability of a system to relate visual stimuli to its knowledge of the world. Although humans perform this task effortlessly and without thinking about it, a general algorithmic solution has not yet been found. Recently, a shift from devising isolated recognition techniques towards integrated systems could be observed [Y. Aloimonos, Active vision revisited, in: Y. Aloimonos (Ed.), Active Perception, Lawrence Efibaum, 1993, pp. 1{\^a}18; H. Christensen, Cognitive (vision) systems, {ERCIM} News (April, 2003). 17{\^a}18]. The visual active memory ({VAM)} perspective refines this system view towards an interactive computational framework for recognition systems in human everyday environments. {VAM} is in line with the recently emerged Cognitive Vision paradigm [H. Christensen, Cognitive (vision) systems, {ERCIM} News (April, 2003). 17{\^a}18] which is concerned with vision systems that evaluate, gather and integrate contextual knowledge for visual analysis. It consists of active processes that generate knowledge by means of a tight cooperation of perception, reasoning, learning and prior models. In addition, {VAM} emphasizes the dynamic representation of gathered knowledge. The memory is assumed to be structured in a hierarchy of successive memory systems that mediate the modularly defined processing components of the recognition system. Recognition and learning take place in the stress field of objects, actions, activities, scene context, and user interaction. In this paper, we exemplify the {VAM} perspective by means of existing demonstrator systems. Assuming three different perspectives (biological foundation, system engineering, and computer vision), we will show that the {VAM} concept is central to the cognitive capabilities of the system and that it leads to a more general object recognition framework.},

The activity map utilizes results inferred from a location-aware activity recognition approach to statistically show a resident's possibly interleaved activities along with corresponding location-related contexts. With observations from a variety of multi-modal and non-intrusive wireless sensors, the approach utilizes a Bayesian network fusion engine with inputs from a set of the most informative features extracted from the sensors and applies joint inference to improve the accuracy and consistency of activity and location estimates. Additionally, each feature has to reckon its corresponding reliability factor to control its contribution in case of possible device failure, therefore making the system more tolerant to inevitable disturbance commonly encountered in a cluttered home environment. This mechanism can cope with some inherent sensor limitations and noise interference, thus improving overall robustness and performance. All experiments were conducted in an instrumented living lab and their results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.},

However, in all of these experiments participants were given an overview of all available pieces of information, selected them simultaneously, and did not process the requested information during the selection phase. In the present research the authors show that an even stronger preference for supporting information arises if information is presented and processed sequentially instead of simultaneously (Experiment 1), and they demonstrate that this stronger confirmation bias is due to sequential presentation and not to sequential processing of information (Experiment 2). The authors provide evidence that the increase in confirmation bias under sequential presentation is caused by heightened commitment due to the participants' increased focusing on their decision (Experiments 3 and 4).

	Abstract = {Since the seminal book, The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction, the {GOMS} model has been one of the few widely known theoretical concepts in human-computer interaction. This concept has spawned much research to verify and extend the original work and has been used in real-world design and evaluation situations. This article synthesizes the previous work on {GOMS} to provide an integrated view of {GOMS} models and how they can be used in design. We briefly describe the major variants of {GOMS} that have matured sufficiently to be used in actual design. We then provide guidance to practitioners about which {GOMS} variant to use for different design situations. Finally, we present examples of the application of {GOMS} to practical design problems and then summarize the lessons learned.},

@article{klayman_overconfidence:_1999,
	Abstract = {Many studies have reported that the confidence people have in their judgments exceeds their accuracy and that overconfidence increases with the difficulty of the task. However, some common analyses confound systematic psychological effects with statistical effects that are inevitable if judgments are imperfect. We present three experiments using new methods to separate systematic effects from the statistically inevitable. We still find systematic differences between confidence and accuracy, including an overall bias toward overconfidence. However, these effects vary greatly with the type of judgment. There is little general overconfidence with two-choice questions and pronounced overconfidence with subjective confidence intervals. Over- and underconfidence also vary systematically with the domain of questions asked, but not as a function of difficulty. We also find stable individual differences. Determining why some people, some domains, and some types of judgments are more prone to overconfidence will be important to understanding how confidence judgments are made.},

Using spatial clustering and temporal alignment, each gesture is defined to be an ordered sequence of states in spatial-temporal space. The {2D} image positions of the centers of the head and both hands of the user are used as features; these are located by a color-based tracking method. From training data of a given gesture, we first learn the spatial information and then group the data into segments that are automatically aligned temporally. The temporal information is further integrated to build a finite state machine ({FSM)} recognizer. Each gesture has a {FSM} corresponding to it. The computational efficiency of the {FSM} recognizers allows us to achieve real-time on-line performance. We apply this technique to build an experimental system that plays a game of {ldquo;Simon} Says rdquo; with the user},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for automatic segmentation and recognition of continuous human activity. We segment a continuous human activity into separate actions and correctly identify each action. The camera views the subject from the lateral view: there are no distinct breaks or pauses between the execution of different actions. We have no prior knowledge about the commencement or termination of each action. We compute the angles subtended by three major components of the body with the vertical axis, namely the torso, the upper component of the leg and the lower component of the leg. Using these three angles as a feature vector we classify frames into breakpoint and non-breakpoint frames. Breakpoints indicate an action's commencement or termination. We use single action sequences for the training data set. The test sequences, on the other hand are continuous sequences of human activity that consist of three or more actions in succession. The system has been tested on continuous activity sequences containing actions such as walking, sitting down, standing up, bending, getting up, squatting and rising. It detects the breakpoints and classifies the actions between them},

@article{durso_linking_2008,
	Abstract = {Objective: The main objective of this study is to present a methodology for computing information relevance. Background: Relevance is a pervasive term used in several domains, such as pragmatics, information science, and psychology. Quantifying the relevance of information can be helpful in effective display design. Displays should be designed so that the more relevant information is more easily accessed. Method: This procedure focuses on computing the relevance of a piece of information by taking into account three aspects of tasks that use the information: the number of different tasks that make use of the information, the frequency of occurrence of those tasks, and the criticality of those tasks. The methodology can be used to compute the aggregate relevance of a piece of information for a particular component of a system or for the entire system. This methodology was illustrated using the domain of air traffic control ({ATC).} Results: In support of the validity of the methodology, we were able to confirm the value of weather information and traffic information in {ATC} towers. Conclusion: The method can be used to derive information relevance, a characteristic of information that has implications for display design for any domain. Application: Designers can use information about aggregate relevance to design information displays that feature the most relevant information.},

The process is characterized by the definition of knowledge requirements, a normative model structure of human-machine interaction, a knowledge architecture that implements the model, and an interactive real-time simulation environment. The knowledge requirements largely specify the model, knowledge architecture, and simulation. The model and the knowledge architecture are the basis for the design of intelligent systems. The simulation serves as an experimental testbed that provides a feasible, safe, and effective means for exploring alternative human-machine systems designs and also facilitates technology transfer. The aim is to create an understanding of a complex work domain that forms the context for ongoing research in human-machine interaction.

A multi-agent event is composed of several action threads related by temporal constraints.

In graph embedding, each algorithm can be considered as the direct graph embedding or its linear/kernel/tensor extension of a specific intrinsic graph that describes certain desired statistical or geometric properties of a data set, with constraints from scale normalization or a penalty graph that characterizes a statistical or geometric property that should be avoided. Furthermore, the graph embedding framework can be used as a general platform for developing new dimensionality reduction algorithms. By utilizing this framework as a tool, we propose a new supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called marginal Fisher analysis in which the intrinsic graph characterizes the intraclass compactness and connects each data point with its neighboring points of the same class, while the penalty graph connects the marginal points and characterizes the interclass separability. We show that {MFA} effectively overcomes the limitations of the traditional linear discriminant analysis algorithm due to data distribution assumptions and available projection directions. Real face recognition experiments show the superiority of our proposed {MFA} in comparison to {LDA}, also for corresponding kernel and tensor extensions},

Ubiquitous computing and rich sensor-filled environments are finding their way out of the laboratory, not just into movies but also into our workplaces and homes. The computer has broken out of its plastic and glass bounds providing us with networked societies where personal computing devices from mobile phones to smart cards fill our pockets and electronic devices surround us at home and work. The web too has grown from a largely academic network into the hub of business and everyday lives. As the distinctions between the physical and the digital, and between work and leisure start to break down, human-computer interaction is also changing {radically.The} excitement of these changes is captured in this new edition, which also looks forward to other emerging technologies. However, the book is firmly rooted in strong principles and models independent of the passing technologies of the day: these foundations will be the means by which today s students will understand tomorrow s {technology.The} third edition of h"uman computer interaction" can be used for introductory and advanced courses on {HCI}, Interaction Design, Usability or Interactive Systems Design. It will also prove an invaluable reference for professionals wishing to design usable computing {devices.Accompanying} the text is a comprehensive website containing a broad range of material for instructors, students and practitioners, a full text search facility for the book, links to many sites of additional interest and much more: go to www.hcibook.com New to this edition: A revised structure, reflecting the growth of {HCI} as a discipline, separates out basic material suitable for introductory courses from more detailed models and theories.

@article{brown_improved_2005,
	Abstract = {Doppler velocity and reflectivity measurements from Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler ({WSR-88D)} radars provide important input to forecasters as they prepare to issue short-term severe storm and tornado warnings. Current-resolution data collected by the radars have an azimuthal spacing of 1.0{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ and range spacing of 1.0 km for reflectivity and 0.25 km for Doppler velocity and spectrum width. To test the feasibility of improving data resolution, National Severe Storms Laboratory{\^a}s test bed {WSR-88D} ({KOUN)} collected data in severe thunderstorms using 0.5{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$-azimuthal spacing and 0.25-km-range spacing, resulting in eight times the resolution for reflectivity and twice the resolution for Doppler velocity and spectrum width. Displays of current-resolution {WSR-88D} Doppler velocity and reflectivity signatures in severe storms were compared with displays showing finer-resolution signatures. At all ranges, fine-resolution data provided better depiction of severe storm characteristics. Eighty-five percent of mean rotational velocities derived from fine-resolution mesocyclone signatures were stronger than velocities derived from current-resolution signatures. Likewise, about 85\% of Doppler velocity differences across tornado and tornadic vortex signatures were stronger than values derived from current-resolution data. In addition, low-altitude boundaries were more readily detected using fine-resolution reflectivity data. At ranges greater than 100 km, fine-resolution reflectivity displays revealed severe storm signatures, such as bounded weak echo regions and hook echoes, which were not readily apparent on current-resolution displays. Thus, the primary advantage of fine-resolution measurements over current-resolution measurements is the ability to detect stronger reflectivity and Doppler velocity signatures at greater ranges from a {WSR-88D.}},

@article{vessey_cognitive_1991,
	Abstract = {From a broad perspective, our research can be viewed as investigating the fit of technology to task, the user's view of the fit between technology and task, and the relative importance of each to problem-solving or decision-making {performance.The} technology investigated in this research is the mode of information presentation. Although there has been a considerable amount of research into problem solving using graphs and tables, until recently the circumstances in which each is more effective have been largely unresolved. Recent research has suggested that performance benefits accrue when cognitive fit occurs, i.e., when factors such as the problem representation and problem solving tools match the characteristics of the task. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the basic paradigm of cognitive fit and extensions to the paradigm in a laboratory experiment that examined the nature of subjects' mental representations as well as problem-solving performance. The experiment, using 128 {MBA} students in two identical, repeated measures designs, produced the following results:{\^a}¢ Performance improved markedly for symbolic tasks when the problem representation matched the {task.Performance} effects also resulted from matching specific problem-solving skills to the problem representation and the task, and to a lesser extent when the skills matched the task alone.{\^a}¢ The incremental effects of matching skills to the problem representation and/or the task were small compared with the primary effects of cognitive fit-that of matching problem representation to task.{\^a}¢ A large proportion of problem solvers have insight into the concept of supporting tasks with certain types of problem representation and vice versa.{\^a}¢ Participants preferred to use tables rather than graphs; they also preferred to solve symbolic rather than spatial {problems.Finally}, the problem representation more significantly influenced the mental representation than did task {conceptualization.This} research suggests that providing decision support systems to satisfy individual managers' desires will not have a large effect on either the efficiency or the effectiveness of problem solving. Designers should, instead, concentrate on determining the characteristics of the tasks that problem solvers must address, and on supporting those tasks with the appropriate problem representations and support tools. Sufficient evidence now exists to suggest that the notion of cognitive fit may be one aspect of a general theory of problem solving. Suggestions are made for extending the notion of fit to more complex problem-solving environments.},

	Abstract = {Training is a critical issue for operators responsible for the safe and efficient operation of large-scale complex dynamic systems. This paper proposes and articulates a set of requirements for an intelligent tutoring system. The requirements specify what (instructional content) and how (instructional strategies) to teach a novice operator to supervise and control a complex dynamic system. The instructional content teaches system structure and behavior (i.e., declarative knowledge), system procedures (i.e., procedural knowledge), and how to use this declarative and procedural knowledge to manage a complex dynamic system in real time (i.e., operational skill). Using the underlying representations of the operator function model ({OFM)} and {OFMspert}, the {OFM's} computational implementation. {GT-VITA} (Georgia Tech Visual and Inspectable Tutor and Assistant) realizes these requirements. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, an instance of the generic {GT-VITA} tutoring architecture was implemented for satellite ground controllers. The empirical evaluation, utilizing {NASA} satellite ground control personnel, showed that {GT-VITA} was a flexible and useful training system. In fact, {NASA} has adopted {VITA} as the foundation for required training for all satellite ground control personnel. In addition to an intelligent tutoring system architecture, by using and extending the operator function model and {OFMspert}, {GT-VITA} demonstrates a robust methodology for conceptualizing the tutor-aid paradigm. The tutor-aid paradigm defines a conceptual framework in which learning with a intelligent tutor gradually becomes collaboration with an intelligent associate. Using the same structures (i.e., {OFM} and {OFMspert)} and the same domain knowledge, {GT-VITA} specifies a tutor and {GT-MOCA} (Jones and Mitchell, 1995) specifies an aid},

	Abstract = {The increasing technological sophistication of ship navigation systems may significantly alter the skills, knowledge, and strategies involved in navigating large ships. Many examples in other domains illustrate the dangers of technology-driven innovations. These examples show that without a systematic method to detect design flaws and training requirements, technology-driven designs may degrade rather than enhance maritime safety. The operator function model ({OFM)} provides the basis for examining technological innovations; however, the {OFM} does not describe specific cognitive demands. Augmenting the {OFM} with a description of cognitive operations provides a structured cognitive task analysis tool-{OFM-COG-that} can identify the design and training requirements needed to safeguard system performance. This approach identifies how to tailor designs, develop training, and adjust qualifications to minimize the human errors that might otherwise accompany technological innovation. The paper shows how {OFM-COG} can catalog differences between traditional navigation systems and those augmented with electronic charts and collision avoidance systems. Specifically, it examines the cognitive demands of collision avoidance and track keeping, with and without advanced technological aids. This analysis demonstrates that some advanced radars may in fact increase the likelihood of certain collisions, and that the current certification process does not reflect the cognitive demands of the new technology. The analysis also indicates that electronic chart display and information systems ({ECDIS)} can reduce the redundancy that has served to make traditional systems quite reliable. Drawing upon these examples, the paper describes {OFM-COG} and demonstrates how this model-based analysis technique can document the cognitive implications of technological innovations},

In spite of significant work on automated manufacturing systems, human operators still play a critical role in virtually every system, especially for material-handling processes. To build a model for control and analysis of a system where a human operator is integrated, a formal functional specification of a human material handler ({MH)} is presented in a hierarchical framework. Two types of human operational errors associated with material-handling tasks are also classified and discussed. A shop floor control example is provided to illustrate the proposed modeling framework},

	Abstract = {People's reasoning with uncertainty information is often flawed. Visual representations can help, but little is known about what is the best way to present such information. Two studies investigated the effect of visualizations on the understanding and use of wind speed forecast uncertainty. Participants varied in expertise from novices in weather forecasting (Experiment 1) to professional forecasters (Experiment 2). The authors investigated three visualizations: (a) a chart showing the amount of uncertainty, (b) a chart showing the worst-case scenario, and (c) a box plot of likely wind speeds. Participants were asked to determine the relative uncertainty in the forecast, predict wind speed, and decide whether to post a high-wind warning advisory. The results for novices and professional forecasters were similar. The uncertainty chart enhanced awareness of the degree of uncertainty associated with the forecast, box plots improved reading accuracy, and presenting a visualization of the worst-case scenario introduced bias in the deterministic wind speed forecast. An interactive display (e.g., a combination of an uncertainty chart with a box plot display) may be optimal to convey uncertainty information.},

@article{sanders_subjective_1963,
	Abstract = {The subjective process of probability forecasting is analyzed. It is found to contain a sorling aspect, in which the forecaster distributes all instances into an ordered set of categories of likelihood of occurrence, and a laboling aspect, in which the forecaster assigns an anticipated relative frequency, or probability, of occurrence for each category. These two aspects are identified with the concepts of sharpness and validity, which have been introduced by other writers. The verification score proposed by Brier is shown to consist of the sum of measures of these two qualities. A satisfactory measure of synoptic skill is obtained by applying the Brier score to the synoptic probability forecast and to a control forecast of the climatological probability, and by expressing the difference as a percentage of the control score. In an analysis of a large number of short-range probability forecasts made by instructors and students in the synoptic laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology it is found that even inexperienced forecasters are capable of displaying validity and skill except when dealing with events which occur very rarely or nearly always. Skill for average or net conditions over 24-hr periods is found to he roughly twice the skill in forecasts for a particular instant and is found to vary with the directness with which the weather element can be inferred from prognostic charts. The average of the judgment of two or more forecasters with comparable experience is found to be a more skillful statement than the forecast of the most skilled individual.},

@inproceedings{guerlain_user-initiated_1996,
	Abstract = {Monitoring activities in a process control environment are quite unique depending on the current situation and the operator's current understanding of that situation. Furthermore, the operator may be required to monitor multiple simultaneous events over potentially long periods of time. Currently, operators must periodically scan displays to gather such information, or manipulate the alarm or control system in ways not originally intended in order to gather that information as appropriate. Furthermore, if the monitoring activities span multiple operating shifts, then there is the potential for operators to forget to communicate these requirements at shift change. Despite the uniqueness of the situations that will require process events to be monitored, it is hypothesized that there is a limited set of conditions that can be pre-defined in a tool that will allow operators to set up their own monitoring {\^a}agents{\^a} according to their current diagnostic needs. Such a tool is predicted to decrease the working memory load of operators, and reduce the time it takes them to detect important process changes (or lack of them). Furthermore, it is proposed that this concept is extensible to other plant personnel and to other domains that have similar monitoring requirements. Although some potential pitfalls can be predicted with the introduction of this tool, the number of predicted benefits warrant the further exploration of this concept. This will be the next step in our design process.},

	Abstract = {We describe empirical results from a multi-disciplinary project that support modeling complex processes of land-use and land-cover change in exurban parts of Southeastern Michigan. Based on two different conceptual models, one describing the evolution of urban form as a consequence of residential preferences and the other describing land-cover changes in an exurban township as a consequence of residential preferences, local policies, and a diversity of development types, we describe a variety of empirical data collected to support the mechanisms that we encoded in computational agent-based models. We used multiple methods, including social surveys, remote sensing, and statistical analysis of spatial data, to collect data that could be used to validate the structure of our models, calibrate their specific parameters, and evaluate their output. The data were used to investigate this system in the context of several themes from complexity science, including have (a) macro-level patterns; (b) autonomous decision making entities (i.e., agents); (c) heterogeneity among those entities; (d) social and spatial interactions that operate across multiple scales and (e) nonlinear feedback mechanisms. The results point to the importance of collecting data on agents and their interactions when producing agent-based models, the general validity of our conceptual models, and some changes that we needed to make to these models following data analysis. The calibrated models have been and are being used to evaluate landscape dynamics and the effects of various policy interventions on urban land-cover patterns.},

Among these trends are increased levels of automation, increasing differentiation and customization of products, and increased demands on system performance. A control system must coordinate the various activities of a manufacturing operation so that requirements and performance goals are met. Most manufacturing control systems are distributed in nature and incorporate both computerized controllers and human operators. There are few generic modeling approaches, however, which represent interactions between these manufacturing control entities. This research proposes a modeling approach which synthesizes a generic architecture for modeling computerized manufacturing control and the operator function model ({OFM)}, a methodology to model operator actions and tasks in complex systems. This approach is based on an underlying client-server representation and has the potential to facilitate design and prototyping of manufacturing control systems},

Abnormal eye behavior, steering wheel activity, and vehicle trajectory during different drowsiness stages were studied in detail to overcome the limitations of single-sensor approaches. Some measures, such as percentage of eyelid closure, maximum close duration, and percentage of nonsteering were analyzed using analysis of variance ({ANOVA)} methods. Moreover, a two-stage data fusion framework was developed for the modeling combination of information from different sources. Fisher's linear discriminant was implied as the feature-level fusion method, and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory was introduced in the decision-level fusion process. The results suggest that the recognition system proposed here provided 90.7\% accuracy. The reliability and accuracy of the fusion method were significantly higher than those of single sensors. {\^A}{\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Using an entropy argument, it is shown that stochastic context-free grammars ({SCFG's)} can model sources with hidden branching processes more efficiently than stochastic regular grammars (or equivalently {HMM's).} However, the automatic estimation of {SCFG's} using the Inside-Outside algorithm is limited in practice by its O(n3) complexity. In this paper, a novel pre-training algorithm is described which can give significant computational savings. Also, the need for controlling the way that non-terminals are allocated to hidden processes is discussed and a solution is presented in the form of a grammar minimization procedure.},

@article{brown_improved_2002,
	Abstract = {The magnitude of the Doppler velocity signature of a tornado depends on the effective width of the radar beam relative to the size of the tornado. The effective beamwidth is controlled by the antenna pattern beamwidth and the azimuthal sampling interval. Simulations of Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler ({WSR-88D)} velocity signatures of tornadoes, presented in this paper, show that signature resolution is greatly improved when the effective beamwidth of the radar is reduced. Improved signature resolution means that stronger signatures can be resolved at greater ranges from the radar. Using a special recording device on the National Weather Service's Radar Operations Center's {KCRI} test bed radar, Archive Level I time series data were collected during the {Oklahoma{\^a}Kansas} tornado outbreak of 3 May 1999. Two Archive Level {II} meteorological datasets, each having a different effective beamwidth, were created from the Archive Level I dataset. Since the rotation rate and time interval between pulses are common for both Archive Level {II} datasets, the only parameter that could be changed to reduce the effective beamwidth of the {KCRI} data was the number of pulses, which also changed the azimuthal sampling interval. By cutting the conventional number of pulses in half for one of the Archive Level {II} datasets, the effective beamwidth was decreased by about a quarter and the azimuthal sampling interval was decreased from 1.0{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ to 0.5{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$. The 3 May 1999 data confirm the simulation results that stronger Doppler velocity signatures of tornadoes typically are produced when the azimuthal sampling interval, and thus the effective beamwidth, is decreased.},

In three studies, meteorologists made forecasts under a total of four different information conditions. Forecast accuracy was low, and as the amount and quality of the information increased substantially, there was a modest increase in the accuracy of forecasts. The results suggest that subjective factors, particularly the reliability of forecasts, deteriorated with additional information.},

@article{fent_coexistence_2007,
	Abstract = {The question how social norms can emerge from microscopic interactions between individuals is a key problem in social sciences to explain collective behavior. In this paper we propose an agent-based model to show that randomly distributed social behavior by way of local interaction converges to a state with a multimodal distribution of behavior. This can be interpreted as a coexistence of different social norms, a result that goes beyond previous investigations. The model is discrete in time and space, behavior is characterized in a continuous state space. The adaptation of social behavior by each agent is based on attractive and repulsive forces caused by friendly and adversary relations among agents. The model is analyzed both analytically and by means of spatio-temporal computer simulations. It provides conditions under which we find convergence towards a single norm, coexistence of two opposing norms, and coexistence of a multitude of norms. For the latter case, we also show the evolution of the spatio-temporal distribution of behavior.},

@article{devine_domain-specific_1995,
	Abstract = {Recent theory and research has highlighted the importance of domain-specific knowledge in allowing superior performance. Previous studies have shown that task characteristics affect decision making performance, yet few (if any) studies have varied task characteristics in the context of knowledge differences. In this study, two task characteristics (the labeling of alternatives and the structure of the decision) were identified and hypothesized to interact with decision-maker knowledge level in affecting information acquisition and decision accuracy. A computerized information board study using high and low knowledge individuals in the domain of basketball found that both task characteristics interacted with knowledge level to affect information acquisition and decision accuracy. High knowledge individuals were significantly more accurate than low knowledge individuals on well-structured decisions but not on ill-structured decisions. Further, high knowledge individuals reduced information search when decisions were well-structured and when alternatives were descriptively labeled, and acquired considerably more contextual information than low knowledge individuals across all conditions. On the other hand, low knowledge information acquisition appeared to be largely unaffected by decision structure or descriptive labeling. The discussion highlights the need to view superior performance as a complex function of existing knowledge, task demands and information search.},

Traditional techniques that have been applied to that domain from game theory and artificial intelligence have generalized poorly from simplified paradigms to real-world conditions. We describe a competing approach rooted in cognitive architectures and distinguished by multiple levels of processes that involve complex interactions of microcognitive constructs. The naturalistic requirements of the task impose upon the cognitive architecture additional constraints beyond those involved in modeling laboratory experiments. We describe a number of improvements to the cognitive architecture designed to boost its robustness in uncertain, unpredictable, and adaptive environments characteristic of adversarial behavior. What emerges is a symbiotic relation between macrocognitive processes that drive improvements in microcognitive constructs, which in turn provide a computational account of the realization of those processes in human cognition.},

	Abstract = {The task of diagnosis is a very important topic in many different
contexts. In highly complex technical installations involving high
hazards, such as process plants, diagnosis is a crucial part of
disturbance control; in technical maintenance, diagnosis is necessary to
locate the root cause of system failures; and in medicine, diagnosis is
the basis for any patient treatment. The paper presents a discussion of
the basic nature of causal reasoning as applied for diagnosis and the
mental strategies applied when diagnosis is viewed as an integrated part
of {\^a}natural decision making{\^a} for interaction with the
environment. A typology is suggested to characterize diagnosis in
different domains such as process control, maintenance and medicine. In
addition, an attempt is made to distinguish between the features of
diagnosis depending on the ultimate aim, whether it is explanation,
compensation, repair, or punishment and the difference in the context of
the task, {\^a}the causal field,{\^a} related to the mental model
involved in the different cases is outlined},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in computer vision technology have lead to the development of various automatic surveillance systems, however their effectiveness is adversely affected by many factors and they are not completely reliable. This study investigated the potential of a semi-automated surveillance system to reduce {CCTV} operator workload in both detection and tracking activities. A further focus of interest was the degree of user reliance on the automated system. A simulated prototype was developed which mimicked an automated system that provided different levels of system confidence information. Dependent variable measures were taken for secondary task performance, reliance and subjective workload. When the automatic component of a semi-automatic {CCTV} surveillance system provided reliable system confidence information to operators, workload significantly decreased and spare mental capacity significantly increased. Providing feedback about system confidence and accuracy appears to be one important way of making the status of the automated component of the surveillance system more {\^a}visible{\^a} to users and hence more effective to use.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel model for human action categorization. A video sequence is represented as a collection of spatial and spatial-temporal features by extracting static and dynamic interest points. We propose a hierarchical model that can be characterized as a constellation of bags-of-features and that is able to combine both spatial and spatial-temporal features. Given a novel video sequence, the model is able to categorize human actions in a frame-by-frame basis. We test the model on a publicly available human action dataset [2] and show that our new method performs well on the classification task. We also conducted control experiments to show that the use of the proposed mixture of hierarchical models improves the classification performance over bag of feature models. An additional experiment shows that using both dynamic and static features provides a richer representation of human actions when compared to the use of a single feature type, as demonstrated by our evaluation in the classification task.},

@phdthesis{zhou_statistical_2008,
	Abstract = {Recently, considerable attention has been focused on object recognition using three-dimensional ({3D)} geometry information. Much of this is motivated by the increasing availability of {3D} measurement systems and the richness inherent in the {3D} data they collect. In our study for {3D} object recognition, a general probabilistic {"Point-Cloud"} data representation is used to represent the measurement data. Statistical models are employed to address the randomness such as measurement uncertainties, pose errors, unknown poses inherent in the object recognition, and these models yield the developing of statistical approaches for {3D} object recognition in this study. In this dissertation, we first give a pair of algorithms, one optimal and the other approximate, for recognizing {3D} objects from a point-cloud chosen from their surface according to some probabilistic mechanism. Secondly, an extensive simulation-based data and model accuracy requirement analysis focusing on the optimal algorithm is conducted for the scenarios of using airborne laser radar (ladar) as the {3D} measurement system for classifying very similar ground vehicles, and this analysis can provide the implementation guidelines for the designers of practical ladar recognition systems. Thirdly, the general clutter models are developed to accommodate the measurements from unwanted objects in the scene, and a joint segmentation-classification algorithm is derived for classifying objects in the cluttered environment. Fourthly, we look at improving the recognition robustness for objects with pose errors. The method we proposed requires simple computation and delivers good performance. Fifthly, a coarse-to-fine pose estimation algorithm is proposed to integrate with the classification algorithms for classifying objects with unknown pose. Finally, we give a method for estimating the recognition performance based on small amount of sample data, and this method can be particularly useful for providing rough and quick answers in the requirement analysis for recognition systems.},

Two potential mechanisms for mental projection are examined: (1) mental simulation (performing a mental play by play) and (2) pattern matching (identifying critical features of the situation and matching those with previous experience). A study was performed in cooperation with the National Weather Service Warning Decision Training Branch in which 28 severe weather warning forecasters participated in an interval-based simulation. At three decision points in this simulation, participants were asked to assess the threat level for tornado, wind, hail, and flash flood and to delineate their rationale for each assessment. Results are presented that support the existence of pattern matching and mental simulation strategies, that suggest different strategies may be effective in different situations, and that indicate forecasters utilize both strategies.},

Its measures were also used for statistical tests of aggregate effects across human judges. Two between-subject manipulations were crossed to investigate {HAJL's} sensitivity to interventions in the human's training (sensor noise during training) and in display design (information from the automation about its judgment strategy). {HAJL} identified that the design intervention impacted conflict and compromise with the automation, participants learned from the automation over time, and those with higher individual judgment achievement were also better able to predict the automation.},

	Abstract = {We propose that current models of graph comprehension do not adequately capture how people use graphs and complex visualizations. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined 3 sessions of scientists using an in vivo methodology. We found that in order to obtain information from their graphs, scientists not only read off information directly from their visualizations (as current theories predict), but they also used a great deal of mental imagery "which we call spatial transformations". We propose an extension to the current model of visualization comprehension and usage to account for this data.},

	Abstract = {The project conceived in 1929 by Gardner Murphy and the writer aimed first to present a wide array of problems having to do with five major "attitude areas"--international relations, race relations, economic conflict, political conflict, and religion. The kind of questionnaire material falls into four classes: yes-no, multiple choice, propositions to be responded to by degrees of approval, and a series of brief newspaper narratives to be approved or disapproved in various degrees. The monograph aims to describe a technique rather than to give results. The appendix, covering ten pages, shows the method of constructing an attitude scale. A bibliography is also given.},

	Abstract = {While there are many different computational modeling techniques capable of predicting human decision-making outcomes, training applications require modeling techniques that are also diagnostic of human decision-making processes. Multiple linear regression, a commonly used modeling technique in Psychology, makes overly restrictive processing assumptions such as that of additivity. A relatively new modeling approach, fuzzy system modeling, bears some striking similarities to current theories of categorization and cognition. In this research, we compare the diagnostic utility of multiple linear regression to fuzzy system models. Specifically, decision-making data are modeled using either linear regression or fuzzy system models, and trainee models are compared to an expert model built with the same technique. Discrepancies between the trainee and expert models are noted and qualitative feedback is generated. The diagnostic utility of each technique is evaluated by measuring changes in performance after model-based feedback is provided to the trainees.},

For complex models such as humans, previous work has required a good initialization, or an alternating minimization between correspondence and pose. In this paper we investigate one-shot pose estimation: can we directly infer correspondences using a regression function trained to be invariant to body size and shape, and then optimize the model pose just once? We evaluate on several challenging single-frame data sets containing a wide variety of body poses, shapes, torso rotations, and image cropping. Our experiments demonstrate that one-shot pose estimation achieves state of the art results and runs in real-time.},

@article{zhou_analysis_2008,
	Abstract = {Considerable attention has recently been focused on laser radar (ladar) systems for surveillance applications, because of the richness inherent in the three-dimensional data they collect. Several research groups have looked into the ability to exploit ladar data in automatic or assisted target recognition systems. Designers of practical ladar recognition systems must have answers to very fundamental questions related to the quality and quantity of data required, the fidelity of target models used by the algorithm, and the effects of incorporating prior knowledge. This paper presents implementation guidelines derived from a simulation-based analysis of many such factors that can affect classification accuracy, including measurement noise and corresponding noise model accuracy, number of measured points on target, target model accuracy, target pose error, prior information, and target occlusion. The study includes data from eight vehicles, including seven civilian automobiles of similar size and shape, chosen specifically to result in a "hard" classification problem. Data are simulated under three hypothetical scenarios: 1) a pole-mounted ladar system for monitoring traffic through an intersection; 2) a low-flying helicopter-born ladar system for law enforcement applications; and 3) a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV)} for military surveillance applications.},

@article{parasuraman_humans_1997,
	Abstract = {This paper addresses theoretical, empirical, and analytical studies pertaining to human use, misuse, disuse, and abuse of automation technology. Use refers to the voluntary activation or disengagement of automation by human operators. Trust, mental workload, and risk can influence automation use, but interactions between factors and large individual differences make prediction of automation use difficult. Misuse refers to overreliance on automation, which can result in failures of monitoring or decision biases. Factors affecting the monitoring of automation include workload, automation reliability and consistency, and the saliency of automation state indicators. Disuse, or the neglect or underutilization of automation, is commonly caused by alarms that activate falsely. This often occurs because the base rate of the condition to be detected is not considered in setting the trade-off between false alarms and omissions. Automation abuse, or the automation of functions by designers and implementation by managers without due regard for the consequences for human performance, tends to define the operator's roles as by-products of the automation. Automation abuse can also promote misuse and disuse of automation by human operators. Understanding the factors associated with each of these aspects of human use of automation can lead to improved system design, effective training methods, and judicious policies and procedures involving automation use.},

	Abstract = {Assessing inter-rater reliability, whereby data are independently coded and the codings compared for agreements, is a recognised process in quantitative research. However, its applicability to qualitative research is less clear: should researchers be expected to identify the same codes or themes in a transcript or should they be expected to produce different accounts? Some qualitative researchers argue that assessing inter-rater reliability is an important method for ensuring rigour, others that it is unimportant; and yet it has never been formally examined in an empirical qualitative study. Accordingly, to explore the degree of inter-rater reliability that might be expected, six researchers were asked to identify themes in the same focus group transcript. The results showed close agreement on the basic themes but each analyst `packaged' the themes differently.},

It is shown that the performance of the combination may be as poor as the poorer detector alone when the inflation in false alarm rate of the combination of detectors is considered. Experimental tests were carried out in which listeners attempted to detect the presence or absence of a tonal signal in noise under two conditions: unaided by an external source of information (actually aided by a simulated machine detector set at chance performance); and aided by a simulated machine detector set at the same discriminability as the listener. While the performance of the aided listener was consistently superior to the unaided listener, the improvement in performance fell considerably short of an ideal combination. It is concluded that the gain in performance expected from combinations of detectors must be interpreted cautiously.},

	Abstract = {This paper demonstrates that a high-resolution reflectivity model used in conjunction with an instrument pointspread function ({PSF)} can both determine georegistration parameters of coarse resolution sensors and improve the spatial resolution by compositing noncoincident repeat satellite data. To demonstrate this ability, an ideal location is selected and several first principle assumptions are made to simplify the reflectivity model. Twenty-three 1-km advanced very high-resolution radiometer ({AVHRR)} images are composited by using a Bayesian statistical sampling technique to yield estimates of a simple terrain-based reflectivity model with 180-m resolution. The terrain values are determined from a 90-m resolution digital elevation model ({DEM).} The Bayesian technique uses the {AVHRR} data to iteratively determine the most likely values for the model spectral albedos contained within an {AVHRR} field of view. Model predicted radiances for the repeat {AVHRR} footprints are computed by integrating model albedo values over the {AVHRR} {PSF.} As a first-order verification, simulated {AVHRR} reflectivities are shown to reconstruct well a smoothly varying prescribed albedo field. Comparisons of the composited real {AVHRR} image result with Landsat Multi Spectral Scanner ({MSS)} data show that the model reconstruction resolves surface features, which are not resolved in a single {AVHRR} image},

These results extend the belief-adjustment model proposed by Hogarth and Einhorn (1992), which does not address information reinterpretations, and always predicts recency effects for an evaluation task with a short series of conflicting information.

	Abstract = {Computer activities have commonly been linked to the development of musculoskeletal disorders ({MSDs)} in the upper limbs. However, to understand the effects computer use has on such disorders, it is necessary to identify and classify the movements involved in performing common computer tasks, one of these being typing. Motion analysis techniques were adopted to determine the movements involved during a typing task. This involved markers being placed on the knuckles, wrists and forearms of participants. This marker configuration allowed for the flexion, extension, radial deviation, ulnar deviation and a combination of these movements to be calculated. The results in one plane of motion show a mean extension{\textbar}flexion and radial{\textbar}ulnar deviation of 18.825{\^A}$\,^{\circ}${\^A} {\^A}$\pm${\^A} 10.013{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ and 5.228{\^A}$\,^{\circ}${\^A} {\^A}$\pm${\^A} 11.703{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ respectively. The most common position in two planes of motion was 20{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ extension with a simultaneous 20{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ ulnar deviation (10.72\%). The results depict an alternative method of categorizing wrist positions in two planes during computer use. Coincident wrist postures should be addressed as opposed to motion in a single plane as these postures may result in different ergonomic risk factors developing.},

@article{kirsh_distinguishing_1994,
	Abstract = {We present data and argument to show that in Tetris{\^a}a real-time, interactive video game-certain cognitive and perceptual problems are more quicklv, easily, and reliably solved by performing actions in the world than by performing computational actions in the head alone. We have found that some of the translations and rotations made by players of this video game are best understood as actions that use the world to improve cognition. These actions are not used to implement a plan, or to implement a reaction; they are used to change the world in order to simplify the problem-solving task. Thus, we distinguish pragmatic actions{\^a}actions performed to bring one physically closer to a goal{\^a}from epistemic actions {\^a}actions performed to uncover informatioan that is hidden or hard to compute mentally.

To illustrate the need for epistemic actions, we first develop a standard information-processing model of Tetris cognition and show that it cannot explain performance data from human players of the game-even when we relax the assumption of fully sequential processing. Standard models disregard many actions taken by players because they appear unmotivated or superfluous. However, we show that such actions are actually far from superfluous; they play a valuable role in improving human performance. We argue that traditional accounts are limited because they regard action as having a single function: to change the world. By recognizing a second function of action{\^a}an epistemic function{\^a}we can explain many of the actions that a traditional model cannot. Although our argument is supported by numerous examples specifically from Tetris, we outline how the new category of epistemic action can be incorporated into theories of action more generally.},

During these field experiments, storm-scale, rapid-scan, volumetric, Doppler-radar observations were obtained in tornadic and nontornadic supercells, quasi-linear mesoscale convective systems, and in both boundary-layer based and elevated ordinary convective cells. A case is made for the use of the radar for studies of convective weather systems and other weather phenomena that evolve on time scales as short as tens of {seconds.CAPSULEThis} manuscript documents the results of a field experiment in which a mobile, rapid-scan, phased-array Doppler radar was used to probe severe convective storms and tornadoes on very short time scales, at relatively close range.},

The detection is based on the Forward-Backward error, i.e. the tracking is performed forward and backward in time and the discrepancies between these two trajectories are measured. We demonstrate that the proposed error enables reliable detection of tracking failures and selection of reliable trajectories in video sequences. We demonstrate that the approach is complementary to commonly used normalized cross-correlation ({NCC).} Based on the error, we propose a novel object tracker called Median Flow.

	Abstract = {{PURPOSE:} To investigate prospectively the trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution in dynamic contrast material{\^a}enhanced bilateral magnetic resonance ({MR)} imaging of the {breast.MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Informed consent and institutional review board approval were obtained. An intraindividual comparative study was performed in 30 patients (mean age, 53 years; age range, 27{\^a}70 years) with a total of 54 enhancing lesions (28 benign and 26 malignant) who underwent dynamic {MR} imaging of the breast twice, once with a standard dynamic protocol (256 {\~A} 256 matrix, 69 seconds per acquisition) and once on a separate day with a modified dynamic protocol (400 {\~A} 512 matrix, 116 seconds per acquisition). Systematic qualitative analysis of morphologic features and region-of-interest{\^a}based analysis of enhancement kinetics were {performed.RESULTS:} A statistically significant difference (generalized linear modeling) in enhancement rates of benign versus malignant lesions was lost when moving from the standard to the modified dynamic protocol. Kinetic information on signal intensity time course patterns was preserved. Delineation of lesion margins and internal architecture was clearly superior with the modified dynamic protocol, which allowed identification of lesion features associated with high positive predictive value or high negative predictive value for breast cancer. Ten benign lesions classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System ({BI-RADS)} category 3 with the standard protocol were correctly downgraded to {BI-RADS} category 2 with the modified protocol owing to visualization of internal septations. Thirteen malignant lesions categorized as {BI-RADS} category 3 or 4 with the standard protocol were correctly upgraded to {BI-RADS} category 4 or 5 with the modified protocol owing to visualization of spicules or rim enhancement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a significantly larger area under the curve for results obtained with the modified dynamic {protocol.CONCLUSION:} Increased spatial resolution significantly improves diagnostic confidence and accuracy at dynamic {MR} imaging, even if this improvement occurs at the expense of temporal resolution. Loss of kinetic information regarding enhancement rates proved to be not diagnostically relevant because enhancement rates showed broad overlap between benign and malignant lesions and were therefore of only limited diagnostic use in the individual patient. Kinetic information regarding time course pattern was preserved and confirmed as having high specificity and high positive predictive value.{\^A}{\copyright} {RSNA}, 2005},

The derived noise model can be used to filter Kinect depth maps for a variety of applications. Our second contribution applies our derived noise model to the {KinectFusion} system to extend filtering, volumetric fusion, and pose estimation within the pipeline.

@article{rabiner_tutorial_1989,
	Abstract = {This tutorial provides an overview of the basic theory of hidden Markov models ({HMMs)} as originated by {L.E.} Baum and T. Petrie (1966) and gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along with a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of {HMMs} are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of {HMMs} that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},

@article{doswell_storm_1999,
	Abstract = {The history of storm spotting and public awareness of the tornado threat is reviewed. It is shown that a downward trend in fatalities apparently began after the famous {{\^a}Tri-State{\^a}} tornado of 1925. Storm spotting{\^a}s history begins in World War {II} as an effort to protect the nation{\^a}s military installations, but became a public service with the resumption of public tornado forecasting, pioneered in 1948 by the Air Force{\^a}s Fawbush and Miller and begun in the public sector in 1952. The current spotter program, known generally as {SKYWARN}, is a civilian-based volunteer organization. Responsibility for spotter training has rested with the national forecasting services (originally, the Weather Bureau and now the National Weather Service). That training has evolved with (a) the proliferation of widespread film and (recently) video footage of severe storms; (b) growth in the scientific knowledge about tornadoes and tornadic storms, as well as a better understanding of how tornadoes produce damage; and (c) the inception and growth of scientific and hobbyist storm chasing. The concept of an integrated warning system is presented in detail, and considered in light of past and present accomplishments and what needs to be done in the future to maintain the downward trend in fatalities. As the integrated warning system has evolved over its history, it has become clear that volunteer spotters and the public forecasting services need to be closely tied. Further, public information dissemination is a major factor in an integrated warning service; warnings and forecasts that do not reach the users and produce appropriate responses are not very valuable, even if they are accurate and timely. The history of the integration has been somewhat checkered, but compelling evidence of the overall efficacy of the watch{\^a}warning program can be found in the maintenance of the downward trend in annual fatalities that began in 1925.},

@article{reason_understanding_1995,
	Abstract = {(1) Human rather than technical failures now represent the greatest threat to complex and potentially hazardous systems. This includes healthcare systems. (2) Managing the human risks will never be 100\% effective. Human fallibility can be moderated, but it cannot be eliminated. (3) Different error types have different underlying mechanisms, occur in different parts of the organisation, and require different methods of risk management. The basic distinctions are between: Slips, lapses, trips, and fumbles (execution failures) and mistakes (planning or problem solving failures). Mistakes are divided into rule based mistakes and knowledge based mistakes. Errors (information-handling problems) and violations (motivational problems) Active versus latent failures. Active failures are committed by those in direct contact with the patient, latent failures arise in organisational and managerial spheres and their adverse effects may take a long time to become evident. (4) Safety significant errors occur at all levels of the system, not just at the sharp end. Decisions made in the upper echelons of the organisation create the conditions in the workplace that subsequently promote individual errors and violations. Latent failures are present long before an accident and are hence prime candidates for principled risk management. (5) Measures that involve sanctions and exhortations (that is, moralistic measures directed to those at the sharp end) have only very limited effectiveness, especially so in the case of highly trained professionals. (6) Human factors problems are a product of a chain of causes in which the individual psychological factors (that is, momentary inattention, forgetting, etc) are the last and least manageable links. Attentional "capture" (preoccupation or distraction) is a necessary condition for the commission of slips and lapses. Yet, its occurrence is almost impossible to predict or control effectively. The same is true of the factors associated with forgetting. States of mind contributing to error are thus extremely difficult to manage; they can happen to the best of people at any time. (7) People do not act in isolation. Their behaviour is shaped by circumstances. The same is true for errors and violations. The likelihood of an unsafe act being committed is heavily influenced by the nature of the task and by the local workplace conditions. These, in turn, are the product of "upstream" organisational factors. Great gains in safety can ve achieved through relatively small modifications of equipment and workplaces. (8) Automation and increasing advanced equipment do not cure human factors problems, they merely relocate them. In contrast, training people to work effectively in teams costs little, but has achieved significant enhancements of human performance in aviation. (9) Effective risk management depends critically on a confidential and preferable anonymous incident monitoring system that records the individual, task, situational, and organisational factors associated with incidents and near misses. (10) Effective risk management means the simultaneous and targeted deployment of limited remedial resources at different levels of the system: the individual or team, the task, the situation, and the organisation as a whole.},

However, the process of teaching students engaged in inquiry provides practice in the application of important research skills. Using a performance rubric, we compared the quality of methodological skills demonstrated in written research proposals for two groups of early career graduate students (those with both teaching and research responsibilities and those with only research responsibilities) at the beginning and end of an academic year. After statistically controlling for preexisting differences between groups, students who both taught and conducted research demonstrate significantly greater improvement in their abilities to generate testable hypotheses and design valid experiments. These results indicate that teaching experience can contribute substantially to the improvement of essential research skills.},

These applications often require the calibration information between the color and the depth cameras. Traditional checkerboard based calibration schemes fail to work well for the depth camera, since its corner features cannot be reliably detected in the depth image. In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood solution for the joint depth and color calibration based on two principles. First, in the depth image, points on the checker board shall be co-planar, and the plane is known from color camera calibration. Second, additional point correspondences between the depth and color images may be manually specified or automatically established to help improve calibration accuracy. Uncertainty in depth values has been taken into account systematically. The proposed algorithm is reliable and accurate, as demonstrated by extensive experimental results on simulated and real-world examples.},

@article{murphy_skill_1988,
	Abstract = {Several skill scores are defined, based on the mean-square-error measure of accuracy and alternative climatological standards of reference. Decompositions of these skill scores are formulated, each of which is shown to possess terms involving 1) the coefficient of correlation between the forecasts and observations, 2) a measure of the nonsystematic (i.e., conditional) bias in the forecast, and 3) a measure of the systematic (i.e., unconditional) bias in the forecasts. Depending on the choice of standard of reference, a particular decomposition may also contain terms relating to the degree of association between the reference forecasts and the observations. These decompositions yield analytical relationships between the respective skill scores and the correlation coefficient, document fundamental deficiencies in the correlation coefficient as a measure of performance, and provide additional insight into basic characteristics of forecasting performance. Samples of operational precipitation probability and minimum temperature forecasts are used to investigate the typical magnitudes of the terms in the decompositions. Some implications of the results for the practice of forecast verification are discussed.},

@article{chung_daily_2008,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a Hierarchical Context Hidden Markov Model ({HC-HMM)} for behavior understanding from video streams in a nursing center. The proposed {HC-HMM} infers elderly behaviors through three contexts which are spatial, activities, and temporal context. By considering the hierarchical architecture, {HC-HMM} builds three modules composing the three components, reasoning in the primary and the secondary relationship. The spatial contexts are defined from the spatial structure, so that it is placed as the primary inference contexts. The temporal duration is associated to elderly activities, so activities are placed in the following of spatial contexts and the temporal duration is placed after activities. Between the spatial context reasoning and behavior reasoning of activities, a modified duration {HMM} is applied to extract activities. According to this design, human behaviors different in spatial contexts would be distinguished in first module. The behaviors different in activities would be determined in second module. The third module is to recognize behaviors involving different temporal duration. By this design, an abnormal signaling process corresponding to different situations is also placed for application. The developed approach has been applied for understanding of elder behaviors in a nursing center. Results have indicated the promise of the approach which can accurately interpret 85\% of the elderly behaviors. For abnormal detection, the approach was found to have 90\% accuracy, with 0\% false alarm.},

@article{bluestein_structure_2007,
	Abstract = {The University of Massachusetts W- and X-band, mobile, Doppler radars scanned several tornadoes at close range in south-central Kansas on 12 May 2004. The detailed vertical structure of the Doppler wind and radar reflectivity fields of one of the tornadoes is described with the aid of boresighted video. The inside wall of a weak-echo hole inside the tornado was terminated at the bottom as a bowl-shaped boundary within several tens of meters of the ground. Doppler signatures of horizontal vortices were noted along one edge in the lowest 500 m of the tornado. The vertical structure of Doppler velocity displayed significant variations on the 100-m scale. Near the center of the tornado, a quasi-horizontal, radial bulge of the weak-echo hole at {\^a}{\OE}500{\^a}600 m {AGL} dropped to about 400 m above the ground and was evident as a weak-echo band to the south of the tornado. It is suggested that this feature represents echo-weak material transported radially outward by a vertical circulation. Significant vertical variations of Doppler velocity were found in the surface friction layer both inside and outside the tornado core. The shape of a weak-echo notch that was associated with a hook echo wrapped around the tornado is described. Highest Doppler velocities were located outside the condensation funnel.

The approach centers on the use of a cascade of Hidden Markov Models named Layered Hidden Markov Models ({LHMMs)} to diagnose states of a user{\^a}s activity based on real-time streams of evidence from video, audio, and computer (keyboard and mouse) interactions. We couple these {LHMMs} with an expected utility analysis that considers the cost of misclassification. We describe the representation, present an implementation, and report on experiments with our layered architecture in a real-time office-awareness setting.},

This paper describes a color scale that can be used to unambiguously represent these images in printed gray-scale publications as well as full color electronic publications. The image resolution when viewed in color is enhanced in this article. This color scale also allows for correct interpretation by people with common types of color blindness, which accounts for approximately 10\% of the male population and 1\% of the female population. While it may be possible to obtain a better resolution with a color scale that is designed for a particular image on hand, the proposed color scale works well in many applications where the user does not have the time or resources to tailor the color scale to a specific image. The proposed color scale is also easy to implement and has an intuitive interpretation in that it cycles through a sequence of hues that roughly resembles the familiar rainbow.},

There has been no disagreement among research methodologists about the desirability of power analysis in research planning and assessment, yet progress in application of this method over the last quarter century has been slow. There have, however, been some rays of hope in the past few years. The popularity of meta-analysis has served to emphasize the size of effects and by thus raising the consciousness of behavioral scientists has promoted the cause of power analysis. More directly, both graduate and undergraduate statistics textbooks have begun to feature chapter-length treatments of power analysis. Finally, in addition to the reference works already noted, there are available computer programs for power analysis and sample size determination.},

@article{liang_machining_2004,
	Abstract = {Research in automating the process level of machining operations has been conducted, in both academia and industry, over the past few decades. This work is motivated by a strong belief that research in this area will provide increased productivity, improved part quality, reduced costs, and relaxed machine design constraints. The basis for this belief is two-fold. First, machining process automation can be applied to both large batch production environments and small batch jobs. Second, process automation can autonomously tune machine parameters (feed, speed, depth of cut, etc.) on-line and off-line to substantially increase the machine tool{\^a}s performance in terms of part tolerances and surface finish, operation cycle time, etc. Process automation holds the promise of bridging the gap between product design and process planning, while reaching beyond the capability of a human operator. The success of manufacturing process automation hinges primarily on the effectiveness of the process monitoring and control systems. This paper discusses the evolution of machining process monitoring and control technologies and conducts an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art of these technologies over the past decade. The research in each area is highlighted with experimental and simulation examples. Open architecture software platforms that provide the means to implement process monitoring and control systems are also reviewed. The impact, industrial realization, and future trends of machining process monitoring and control technologies are also discussed.},

@phdthesis{ryoo_semantic_2008,
	Abstract = {This dissertation describes a methodology for automated recognition of complex human activities. The dissertation presents a general framework which reliably recognizes various types of high-level human activities including human actions, human-human interactions, human-object interactions, and group activities. Our approach is a description-based approach, which enables a user to encode the structure of a high-level human activity as a formal representation. Recognition of human activities is done by semantically matching constructed representations with actual observations. The methodology uses a context-free grammar ({CFG)} based representation scheme as a formal syntax for representing composite activities. Our {CFG-based} representation enables us to define complex human activities based on simpler activities or movements. We have constructed a hierarchical framework which automatically matches activity representations with input observations. In the low-level of the system, image sequences are processed to extract poses and gestures. Based on the recognition of gestures, the high-level of the system hierarchically recognizes complex occurring human activities by searching for gestures that satisfies the temporal, spatial, and logical structure described in the representation. The concept of hallucinations and a probabilistic semantic-level recognition algorithm is introduced to cope with imperfect lower-layers. As a result, the system recognizes human activities including 'fighting', 'assault', 'a person leaving a suitcase', and 'a group of thieves stealing an object from owners', which are high-level activities that previous systems had difficulties. The experimental results show that our system reliably recognizes sequences of various types of complex human activities with a high recognition rate.},

Millions of older adults fall every year. The ability to assess the fall risk of elderly individuals is essential to allowing them to continue living safely in independent settings as they age. Studies have shown that measures of stride-to-stride gait variability are predictive of falls in older adults. For this analysis, a set of participants were asked to perform a number of short walks while being monitored by the two vision based systems, along with a marker based Vicon motion capture system for ground truth. Measures of stride-to-stride gait variability were computed using each of the systems and compared against those obtained from the Vicon.},

@article{stankov_self-confidence_1997,
	Abstract = {This study investigates individual differences in confidence judgments made by subjects on the accuracy of their answers to psychological test items. A measure of reasoning ability (the Raven's Progressive Matrices, {RPM)}, a vocabulary test, and a perceptual visual discrimination test, were administered to 271 subjects. For half of the subjects, feedback on the correctness of response was given after each item, while for the other half, no such information was provided. In addition, measures of English and Mathematics self-concept were obtained. Confidence ratings from the Vocabulary test showed overconfidence, while those from the perceptual task showed underconfidence. Confidence ratings from the perceptual task revealed poorer discrimination between correct and incorrect items than did those from the other two tasks. While feedback produced better discrimination, and slower responding for the {RPM} test, higher confidence rating and bias scores were obtained for the Vocabulary test. Correlations between the confidence judgment scores indicate that there is a separate self-confidence trait that is different from ability factors reflecting the speed and accuracy of performance on cognitive test items. English self-concept was found to share low correlation with Vocabulary accuracy and confidence rating measures, a result that was analogous to that obtained for Mathematics self-concept and {RPM} test score. The results of this and earlier studies are discussed in terms of the construct of self-confidence and in relationship to theories of intelligence and personality.},

Our work encourages examination of the complementarities that exist between these fields proposing that some of the challenges associated with micromodeling perspectives may be addressed by drawing upon "midgranularity" cognitive architectures. The study documented here demonstrates the value of modeling macrocognitive phenomena using the midgranularity architecture Convince Me. Our results suggested a moderate degree of fit between fund managers' decision making and the theory of explanatory coherence. Insights into the macrocognitive processes of sense making, uncertainty management, and mental simulation are examined. We anticipate that this will demonstrate the utility of computational modeling for revealing the shortcomings of macrocognitive models and that this will not only motivate increased theoretical specification but will also assist in the legitimization of cognitive modeling methods within macrocognitive inquiry.},

	Abstract = {Training needs analysis is critical to the orderly development of
training systems and the procurement of simulators for training. The
standard methods of Instructional System Development have been neglected
in part because they fail to take full account of cognitive skills and
because the extensive detail generated by these methods has made it
onerous to manipulate the knowledge representation. A contrasting
concern is that many of the newer methods of cognitive task analysis
de-emphasise non-cognitive skills. Training needs analysis for complex
weapons platforms must take account of all aspects of skill. A new
project to develop a training system for an advanced fighter aircraft
will identify discrete operational tasks at a behavioural level but will
extend that effort into a complete cognitive work analysis as outlined
by Rasmussen, Petjersen, and Goodstein (1994). In addition, the scope of
the cognitive work analysis will be expanded to include issues unique to
training and instruction},

@article{lavee_understanding_2009,
	Abstract = {Understanding video events, i.e., the translation of low-level content in video sequences into high-level semantic concepts, is a research topic that has received much interest in recent years. Important applications of this paper include smart surveillance systems, semantic video database indexing, and interactive systems. This technology can be applied to several video domains including airport terminal, parking lot, traffic, subway stations, aerial surveillance, and sign language data. In this paper, we identify the two main components of the event understanding process: abstraction and event modeling. Abstraction is the process of molding the data into informative units to be used as input to the event model. Due to space restrictions, we will limit the discussion on the topic of abstraction. See the study by \textit{Lavee} \textit{et} \textit{al.} (Understanding video events: A survey of methods for automatic interpretation of semantic occurrences in video, Technion-Israel Inst. Technol., Haifa, Israel, Tech. Rep. {CIS-2009-06}, 2009) for a more complete discussion. Event modeling is devoted to describing events of interest formally and enabling recognition of these events as they occur in the video sequence. Event modeling can be further decomposed in the categories of pattern-recognition methods, state event models, and semantic event models. In this survey, we discuss this proposed taxonomy of the literature, offer a unifying terminology, and discuss popular event modeling formalisms (e.g., hidden Markov model) and their use in video event understanding using extensive examples from the literature. Finally, we consider the application domain of video event understanding in light of the proposed taxonomy, and propose future directions for research in this field.},

	Abstract = {Emergency managers ({EMs)} play a critical role in communicating severe weather and tornado warnings to the public, yet communicating the uncertainty of when, where or if a tornado may hit remains a great challenge for {EMs.} Focus group and survey data concerning weather product usage, weather observing spotter interaction, and decisions to warn the public were collected from Oklahoma {EMs} in order to characterize the communication processes {EMs} employ during severe weather outbreaks. These processes include: (1) acquiring weather information, (2) interpreting the information in order to make weather hazard threat assessments, (3) verifying the information, and (4) making time-sensitive warning decisions. The results indicate that while {EMs} use a variety of weather and radar products to acquire information, weather observing spotters are key sources of verification data. With respect to warning the public about tornado threats, sirens are the primary method. These findings are related to the development of a new radar system being developed by the Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere ({CASA)}, so that this new technology can be designed to reduce uncertainty in the {EM} decision-making and warning communication processes.

	Abstract = {In order to recognize human activities, the system is required to learn properties (i.e. structures) of the activities from training samples. However, existing supervised learning approaches lack interactiveness, solely relying on biased training examples provided by the user. Such approaches are limited especially for real-world scenarios where the amount of training videos is not sufficient. In this paper, we present the novel concept of active video composition learning, a new interactive activity learning paradigm designed to overcome the limitations of the previous paradigm. In contrast to previous passive learning systems relying on user-provided training videos, our approach learns human activities by actively interacting with the human teacher. The idea is to make the system generate composed videos with the activity structure it is most uncertain of and ask the human to provide activity labels for such video queries. In addition, a methodology to semantically represent the system's activity learning status is designed, making the system to interactively inform the human teacher its status and benefit from such interaction. The experimental results confirm that our approach interactively estimates the decision boundaries in the activity structure space, and does it more reliably even when very few real training videos are provided.},

	Abstract = {Terrain and radar beam-elevation data are used to examine the spatial coverage provided by the national operational network of Doppler weather radars. This information is of importance to a wide variety of users, and potential users, of radar data from the national network. Charts generated for radar coverage at 3 and 5 km above mean sea level show that radar surveillance near 700 and 500 {hPa} is very limited for some portions of the contiguous United States. Radar coverage charts at heights of 1, 2, and 3 km above ground level illustrate the extent of low-level radar data gathered above the actual land surface. These maps indicate how restricted the national radar network coverage is at low levels, which limits the usefulness of the radar data, especially for quantitative precipitation estimation. The analyses also identify several regions of the contiguous United States in which weather phenomena are sampled by many adjacent radars. Thus, these regions are characterized by very comprehensive radar information that could be used in many kinds of research studies.},

Brief reviews of the state of the art are presented, followed by more extensive presentations of contemporary theories, findings, and open issues. I discuss various theories of shape recognition, such as template, feature, Fourier, structural description, Marr-Nishihara, and massively parallel models, and issues such as the reference frames, primitives, top-down processing, and computational architectures used in spatial cognition. This is followed by a discussion of mental imagery, including conceptual issues in imagery research, theories of imagery, imagery and perception, image transformations, computational complexities of image processing, neuropsychological issues, and possible functions of imagery. Connections between theories of recognition and of imagery, and the relevance of the papers contained in this issue to the topics discussed, are emphasized throughout.},

Background: {NDM} research emerged in the 1980s to study how people make decisions in real-world settings. Method: The findings and methods used by {NDM} researchers are presented along with their implications. Results: The {NDM} framework emphasizes the role of experience in enabling people to rapidly categorize situations to make effective decisions. Conclusion: The {NDM} focus on field settings and its interest in complex conditions provide insights for human factors practitioners about ways to improve performance. Application: The {NDM} approach has been used to improve performance through revisions of military doctrine, training that is focused on decision requirements, and the development of information technologies to support decision making and related cognitive functions.},

@incollection{baak_data-driven_2013,
	Abstract = {The {3D} reconstruction of complex human motions from {2D} color images is a challenging and sometimes intractable problem. The pose estimation problem becomes more feasible when using streams of {2.5D} monocular depth images as provided by a depth camera. However, due to low resolution of and challenging noise characteristics in depth camera images as well as self-occlusions in the movements, the pose estimation task is still far from being simple. Furthermore, in real-time scenarios, the reconstruction task becomes even more challenging since global optimization strategies are prohibitive. To facilitate tracking of full-body human motions from a single depth-image stream, we introduce a data-driven hybrid strategy that combines local pose optimization with global retrieval techniques. Here, the final pose estimate at each frame is determined from the tracked and retrieved pose hypotheses which are fused using a fast selection scheme. Our algorithm reconstructs complex full-body poses in real time and effectively prevents temporal drifting, thus making it suitable for various real-time interaction scenarios.},

	Abstract = {This work presents a system that permits a real-time ergonomic assessment of manual tasks in an industrial environment. First, a biomechanical model of the upper body has been developed by using inertial sensors placed at different locations on the upper body. Based on this model, a computerized {RULA} ergonomic assessment was implemented to permit a global risk assessment of musculoskeletal disorders in real-time. Furthermore, local scores were calculated per segment, e.g. the neck region, and gave information on the local risks for musculoskeletal disorders. Visual information was fed back to the user by using a see-through head mounted display. Additional visual highlighting and auditory warnings were provided when some predefined thresholds were exceeded. In a user study (N{\^A} ={\^A} 12 participants) a group with the {RULA} feedback was compared to a control group. Results demonstrate that the real-time ergonomic feedback significantly decreased the outcome of both globally as well as locally hazardous {RULA} values that are associated with increased risk for musculoskeletal disorders. Task execution time did not differ between groups. The real-time ergonomic tool introduced in this study has the potential to considerably reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders in industrial settings. Implications for ergonomics in manufacturing and user feedback modalities are further discussed.},

	Abstract = {Dense networks of short-range radars capable of mapping storms and detecting atmospheric hazards are described. Composed of small X-band (9.4 {GHz)} radars spaced tens of kilometers apart, these networks defeat the Earth curvature blockage that limits today's long-range weather radars and enables observing capabilities fundamentally beyond the operational state-of-the-art radars. These capabilities include multiple Doppler observations for mapping horizontal wind vectors, subkilometer spatial resolution, and rapid-update (tens of seconds) observations extending from the boundary layer up to the tops of storms. The small physical size and low-power design of these radars permits the consideration of commercial electronic manufacturing approaches and radar installation on rooftops, communications towers, and other infrastructure elements, leading to cost-effective network deployments. The networks can be architected in such a way that the sampling strategy dynamically responds to changing weather to simultaneously accommodate the data needs of multiple types of end users. Such networks have the potential to supplement, or replace, the physically large long-range civil infrastructure radars in use today.},

	Abstract = {Compressing a digital image can facilitate its transmission,
storage, and processing. As radiology departments become increasingly
digital, the quantities of their imaging data are forcing consideration
of compression in picture archiving and communication systems ({PACS)} and
evolving teleradiology systems. Significant compression is achievable
only by lossy algorithms, which do not permit the exact recovery of the
original image. This loss of information renders compression and other
image processing algorithms controversial because of the potential loss
of quality and consequent problems regarding liability, but the
technology must be considered because the alternative is delay, damage,
and loss in the communication and recall of the images. How does one
decide if an image is good enough for a specific application, such as
diagnosis, recall, archival, or educational use? The authors describe
three approaches to the measurement of medical image quality:
signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR)}, subjective rating, and diagnostic accuracy.
They compare and contrast these measures in a particular application,
consider in some depth recently developed methods for determining
diagnostic accuracy of lossy compressed medical images and examine how
good the easily obtainable distortion measures like {SNR} are at
predicting the more expensive subjective and diagnostic ratings. The
examples are of medical images compressed using predictive pruned
tree-structured vector quantization, but the methods can be used for any
digital image processing that produces images different from the
original for evaluation},

	Abstract = {A number of philosophers and psychologists stress the importance of disconfirmation in reasoning and suggest that people are instead prone to a general deleterious "confirmation bias." In particular, it is suggested that people tend to test those cases that have the best chance of verifying current beliefs rather than those that have the best chance of falsifying them. We show, however, that many phenomena labeled "confirmation bias" are better understood in terms of a general positive test strategy. With this strategy, there is a tendency to test cases that are expected (or known) to have the property of interest rather than those expected (or known) to lack that property. We show that the positive test strategy can be a very good heuristic for determining the truth or falsity of a hypothesis under realistic conditions. It can, however, lead to systematic errors or inefficiencies. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2010 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Each station transmits a data message every 15 min via a radio link to the nearest terminal of the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Telecommunications System that relays it to a central site in Norman, Oklahoma. The data message comprises three 5-min averages of most data (and one 15-min average of soil temperatures). The central site ingests the data, runs some quality assurance tests, archives the data, and disseminates it in real time to a broad community of users, primarily through a computerized bulletin board system.

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of framing and time pressure on human judgment performance in a complex multiattribute judgment task. We focus on the decision process of human participants who must choose between pairwise alternatives in a resource-allocation task. We used the Analytic Hierarchy Process ({AHP)} to calculate the relative weights of the four alternatives (i.e., \$\{rm C\}\_\{1\}\$, \$\{rm C\}\_\{2\}\$, \$\{rm C\}\_\{3\}\$ , and \$\{rm C\}\_\{4\}\$) and the judgment consistency. Using the {AHP}, we examined two sets of hypotheses that address the impact of task conditions on the weight prioritization of choice alternatives and the internal consistency of the judgment behavior under varying task conditions. The experiment simulated the allocation of robotic assets across the battlefield to collect data about an enemy. Participants had to make a judgment about which asset to allocate to a new area by taking into account three criteria related to the likelihood of success. We manipulated the information frame and the nature of the task. We found that, in general, participants gave significantly different weights to the same alternatives under different frames and task conditions. Specifically, in terms of ln-transformed priority weights, participants gave significantly lower weights to \$\{rm C\}\_\{2\}\$ and \$\{rm C\}\_\{4\}\$ and higher weight to  \$\{rm C\}\_\{3\}\$ under gain frame than under loss frame, and also, under different task conditions (i.e., Tasks \#1, \#2, and \#3), participants gave significantly higher weight to
-
type="inline"{\textgreater}\$\{ rm C\}\_\{4\}\$ in Task \#1, lower weights to \$\{rm C\}\_\{1\}\$ and \$\{rm C\}\_\{4\}\$, higher weight to \$\{rm C\}\_\{3\}\$ in Task \#2, and lower weight to \$\{rm C\}\_\{3\}\$ in Task \#3. Furthermore, we found that the internal consistency of the decision behavior was worse, first, in the loss frame than the gain frame and, second, under time pressure. Our methodology complements utility-theoretic frameworks by assessing judgment consistency without requiring the use of task-performance outcomes.

Topics range from filtering and smoothing of the hidden Markov chain to parameter estimation, Bayesian methods and estimation of the number of states. In a unified way the book covers both models with finite state spaces and models with continuous state spaces (also called state-space models) requiring approximate simulation-based algorithms that are also described in detail. Many examples illustrate the algorithms and theory. This book builds on recent developments to present a self-contained view.},

@article{andra_warning_2002,
	Abstract = {This paper examines concepts related to warning decision making for the 3 May 1999 tornado outbreak in central Oklahoma. Sixty-six tornadoes occurred during this outbreak, with 58 occurring in the Norman, Oklahoma, National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office ({WFO)} area of responsibility. Verification statistics for the event revealed the {WFO} issued 48 tornado warnings, with a median lead time of 23 min, a false-alarm rate of 0.29, and a probability of detection of 0.89. {WFO} Norman meteorologists utilized a warning decision-making methodology that relied upon 1) scientifically based conceptual models of storm types and their environments, 2) Doppler radar data, 3) ground-truth observations, 4) technology, 5) strategy, and 6) human expertise. This methodology was compared with the ability of radar algorithms [e.g., Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler ({WSR-88D)} Mesocyclone ({MA)} and Tornado Detection Algorithms ({TDA)]} to identify tornado threat. Although the steady-state nature of the isolated long-lived tornadic supercells presumably presented an ideal case for algorithm performance, shortcomings were identified. The most significant finding was the difference in median lead times between the {WFO's} subjective human tornado warning and signature detection by {TDA} for the first tornado associated with each supercell. The first tornado is especially significant because ground truth of the tornado is not yet available and radar signatures are less defined at this early stage. Median lead times were 2 min for {TDA} and 29 min for the {WFO.} The {MA} and {TDA} proved most useful when used as a safety net or check against the {WFO} warnings. The initial tornado warning for one supercell storm would have been delayed had the {TDA} not alerted the meteorologist to investigate the storm.},

At its heart, {HTA} is based upon a theory of performance and has only three governing principles. Originally developed as a means of determining training requirements, there was no way the initial pioneers of {HTA} could have foreseen the extent of its success. {HTA} has endured as a way of representing a system sub-goal hierarchy for extended analysis. It has been used for a range of applications, including interface design and evaluation, allocation of function, job aid design, error prediction, and workload assessment. Ergonomists are still developing new ways of using {HTA} which has assured the continued use of the approach for the foreseeable future.},

From 484 papers, we collected 61 interaction-related usability problems reported in 32 user studies and placed them into our framework of seven costs: (1) Decision costs to form goals; (2) system-power costs to form system operations; (3) Multiple input mode costs to form physical sequences; (4) Physical-motion costs to execute sequences; (5) Visual-cluttering costs to perceive state; (6) View-change costs to interpret perception; (7) State-change costs to evaluate interpretation. We also suggested ways to narrow the gulfs of execution (2-4) and evaluation (5-7) based on collected reports. Our framework suggests a need to consider decision costs (1) as the gulf of goal formation.},

@article{lewis_sample_1994,
	Abstract = {Recently, Virzi (1992) presented data that support three claims regarding sample sizes for usability studies: (1) observing four or five participants will allow a usability practitioner to discover 80\% of a product's usability problems, (2) observing additional participants will reveal fewer and fewer new usability problems, and (3) more severe usability problems are easier to detect with the first few participants. Results from an independent usability study clearly support the second claim, partially support the first, but fail to support the third. Problem discovery shows diminishing returns as a function of sample size. Observing four to five participants will uncover about 80\% of a product's usability problems as long as the average likelihood of problem detection ranges between 0.32 and 0.42, as in Virzi. If the average likelihood of problem detection is lower, then a practitioner will need to observe more than five participants to discover 80\% of the problems. Using behavioral categories for problem severity (or impact), these data showed no correlation between problem severity (impact) and rate of discovery. The data provided evidence that the binomial probability formula may provide a good model for predicting problem discovery curves, given an estimate of the average likelihood of problem detection. Finally, data from economic simulations that estimated return on investment ({ROI)} under a variety of settings showed that only the average likelihood of problem detection strongly influenced the range of sample sizes for maximum {ROI.}},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to the description and analysis of complex Man-Machine Systems ({MMSs)} called Cognitive Systems Engineering ({CSE).} In contrast to traditional approaches to the study of man-machine systems which mainly operate on the physical and physiological level, {CSE} operates on the level of cognitive functions. Instead of viewing an {MMS} as decomposable by mechanistic principles, {CSE} introduces the concept of a cognitive system: an adaptive system which functions using knowledge about itself and the environment in the planning and modification of actions. Operators are generally acknowledged to use a model of the system (machine) with which they work. Similarly, the machine has an image of the operator. The designer of an {MMS} must recognize this, and strive to obtain a match between the machine's image and the user characteristics on a cognitive level, rather than just on the level of physical functions. This article gives a presentation of what cognitive systems are, and of how {CSE} can contribute to the design of an {MMS}, from cognitive task analysis to final evaluation.},

	Abstract = {Understanding natural human activity involves not only identifying the action being performed, but also locating the semantic elements of the scene and describing the person's interaction with them. We present a system that is able to recognize complex, fine-grained human actions involving the manipulation of objects in realistic action sequences. Our method takes advantage of recent advances in sensors and pose trackers in learning an action model that draws on successful discriminative techniques while explicitly modeling both pose trajectories and object manipulations. By combining these elements in a single model, we are able to simultaneously recognize actions and track the location and manipulation of objects. To showcase this ability, we introduce a novel Cooking Action Dataset that contains video, depth readings, and pose tracks from a Kinect sensor. We show that our model outperforms existing state of the art techniques on this dataset as well as the {VISINT} dataset with only video sequences.},

	Abstract = {The first inquiry employed repeated surveys and direct observations of procrastinators to question two traditional assumptions about procrastinators--that they are reliable reporters of how they spend workweeks, and that they are not easily observed in the act of procrastinating. The second inquiry tested an intervention for procrastination (helping new faculty find brief, daily sessions in which to write) that proved effective and relatively unaversive. The effectiveness of the intervention helped to confirm the notion that procrastination of a relatively unstructured activity like scholarly writing has at least two central components, bingeing and busyness.},

West and Nagy also developed and tested a method for applying {GOMS}, (a modeling system based on Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection Rules created by Card, Moran, and Newell, 1983) to model macrocognition. That system was called Sociotechnical {GOMS} ({SGOMS).} In this paper we further discuss the relationship between cognitive modeling and macrocognition and describe our work on implementing the {SGOMS} system in the {ACT-R} cognitive architecture.},

@article{turaga_machine_2008,
	Abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a rapid proliferation of video cameras in all walks of life and has resulted in a tremendous explosion of video content. Several applications such as content-based video annotation and retrieval, highlight extraction and video summarization require recognition of the activities occurring in the video. The analysis of human activities in videos is an area with increasingly important consequences from security and surveillance to entertainment and personal archiving. Several challenges at various levels of processing-robustness against errors in low-level processing, view and rate-invariant representations at midlevel processing and semantic representation of human activities at higher level processing-make this problem hard to solve. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive survey of efforts in the past couple of decades to address the problems of representation, recognition, and learning of human activities from video and related applications. We discuss the problem at two major levels of complexity: 1) "actions" and 2) "activities." {"Actions"} are characterized by simple motion patterns typically executed by a single human. {"Activities"} are more complex and involve coordinated actions among a small number of humans. We will discuss several approaches and classify them according to their ability to handle varying degrees of complexity as interpreted above. We begin with a discussion of approaches to model the simplest of action classes known as atomic or primitive actions that do not require sophisticated dynamical modeling. Then, methods to model actions with more complex dynamics are discussed. The discussion then leads naturally to methods for higher level representation of complex activities.},

To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first to attempt and achieve the articulated motion tracking of two strongly interacting hands.

@article{keller_naturalistic_2010,
	Abstract = {Over the last 20 years, both naturalistic decision making and fast and frugal heuristics programs have radically broken with mainstream decision science, moving beyond the confines of artificial tasks and safe academic laboratories. We document commonalities of these programs and discuss ways in which a synthesis could contribute to a more relevant, precise, predictive, and effective decision science. We begin by reviewing the common roots and philosophies of the two programs, such as their respect for the capable decision maker and their acknowledgment of the importance of task ecology. We then identify four specific areas of synergetic potential, including ecological rationality and metacognition. Our review culminates in a case study of naturalistic heuristics based on a particular class of fast and frugal heuristics. These fast and frugal trees provide examples of effective, well-specified decision-making algorithms applied in a naturalistic domain: emergency medical diagnosis. By leveraging the strengths of each program, we point out some of the ways in which more sustainable progress can be fostered on issues that matter the most{\^a}for example, decisions that save and transform lives.},

	Abstract = {Research on people's confidence in their general knowledge has to date produced 2 fairly stable effects, many inconsistent results, and no comprehensive theory. The authors propose such a comprehensive framework, the theory of probabilistic mental models ({PMM} theory). The theory explains both the overconfidence effect (mean confidence is higher than percentage of answers correct) and the hard{\^a}easy effect (overconfidence increases with item difficulty) reported in the literature and predicts conditions under which both effects appear, disappear, or invert. In addition, it predicts a new phenomenon, the confidence{\^a}frequency effect, a systematic difference between a judgment of confidence in a single event (i.e., that any given answer is correct) and a judgment of the frequency of correct answers in the long run. Two experiments are reported that support {PMM} theory by confirming these predictions, and several apparent anomalies reported in the literature are explained and integrated into the present framework.

	Abstract = {Nuclear power production is a safety-critical process where ultimate execution of process change decisions lie with the operators. Thus it is important to provide the best possible decision support through effective supervisory control operator interfaces. This requires a human factors/ergonomics approach in the modernization of analog instrumentation and control systems of the existing nuclear power plants. In this article, we describe how this approach is being used for modernization of the {ANGRA} I power plant. Using a cognitive task analysis ({CTA)} approach, we observed operators working on an advanced control room of a nuclear power plant digital simulator and noted several opportunities for improvement in the human/system interfaces related to the graphics design, alarm systems and procedure integration. A redesigned prototype was constructed as an alternative to the current simulator and hardcopy procedure manuals. The design improves upon the graphical layout of system information and provides better integration of procedures, automation and alarm systems. The design was validated by expert opinion and a scenario-based {comparison.Relevance} to industry{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Human factors/ergonomics are not playing the role they deserve in the design of process control systems making them less controllable than they could be if human factors were adequately incorporated. The use of human factors approach in the design of process control systems throughout the industry presents many opportunities for improvements with regard to system effectiveness, efficiency, reliability and safety.},

@inproceedings{marhasev_non-stationary_2006,
	Abstract = {Activity recognition is a process by which the ongoing observed behavior of an agent is tracked and mapped to a given model, explaining the behavior and accounting for hidden or unobservable state (e.g., goals or beliefs of the observed agents). Various methods for activity recognition exist. A popular family of such methods rely on Hidden Markov Models {HMMs} and variants for recognition. These models, however, do not account for changes in transition probabilities based on the duration an agent has spent in a given state. This paper investigates Markov models that go beyond existing models, to explicitly model the dependency of transition probabilities on state duration. In particular, we propose the use of Non-stationary Hidden Semi Markov Models ({NHSMMs)} in activity recognition. We present the {NHSMM} model, and compare its performance in recognizing normal and abnormal behavior, using synthetic data from an industry simulator. We show that for relatively simple activity recognition tasks, both {HSMMs} and {NHSMMs} easily and significantly outperform {HMMs.} In more complex tasks, the {NHSMMs} also outperform the {HSMMs}, and allow significantly more accurately recognition.},

@misc{cordazzo_urban_2009,
	Abstract = {In recent years, severe storms have impacted several large cities around the world, producing floods and significant property damage due to the lack of adequate flood warning systems. Such problems have occurred in major {US} cities, for example, the New York City metropolitan area was impacted by a Mesoscale Convective System ({MCS)} in August 2007, with rainfall exceeding three inches in less than two hours in some areas. The subway system was partially closed due to flooding, streets were impassable, and over two and a half million people, and numerous businesses were affected. To activate a warning system at the appropriate scale, a numerical urban flood forecasting model and its application to the New York area is presented. This model has two major integrated components: a hydrological model and a mesoscale meteorological model. The hydrological component employs unstructured two-dimensional grids to capture local terrain effects in a conservative approach to model the surface flow. The numerical weather prediction component is coupled with a real-time data feed from both {NexRad} radar and surface stations to simulate precipitation impact on public infrastructure. A case study of the flooding event that occurred on August 8, 2007 is used to illustrate the capabilities of this integrated system and validity of the approach. We will discuss simulated flood patterns using meteorological model outputs at a one to four km resolution, radar data oversampled at 100m resolution, and surface observations at sparsely located sites. The integrated model is designed to forecast flooding events with a lead time from six to 72 hours. We will discuss how flood modeling in urban areas can be simplified by employing one-dimensional grid elements with a reduction of computational effort and without any loss of generality. Future work to simulate a complete basin, namely coupling this model to a subsurface groundwater three-dimensional porous media simulator employing tetrahedral numerical meshes, will also be discussed.},

	Abstract = {The usefulness of the dual-process theory of automaticity to dynamic decision-making tasks is unclear. Dynamic decision making is characterized by multiple, diverse, and interrelated decisions that are often constrained by time limitations and workload. We investigated the relevance of this theory in a compound task consisting of multiple, dynamic components. In the first experiment, we reproduced the original findings that shaped the theory in a dynamic visual search task. In the second experiment, we added a decision-making component. The results replicated the original findings and extended them to decision-making components. Working under consistent-mapping conditions in the visual search component led to more accurate decision making despite variability in the decision-making conditions. Likewise, working under varied-mapping conditions in the visual search component led to poorer decision making, particularly under high workload. The implications of these results to real-world dynamic tasks are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present techniques for characterizing complex, multi-tasked activities that require both exemplars and models. Exemplars are used to represent object context, image features, and motion appearances to label domainspecific events. Then, by representing each event with a unique symbol, a sequence of interactions can be described as an ordered symbolic string. A model of stochastic contextfree grammar, which is developed using underlying rules of an activity, provides the structure for recognizing semantically meaningful behavior over extended periods. Symbolic strings are parsed using the Earley-Stolcke algorithm to determine the most likely semantic derivation for recognition. Parsing substrings allows us to recognize patterns that describe high-level, complex events taking place over segments of the video sequence. We introduce new parsing strategies to enable error detection and recovery in stochastic context-free grammar and methods of quantifying group and individual  behavior in activities with separable roles. We show through experiments with a popular card game how high-level narratives of multi-player games as well as identification of player strategies and behavior can be extracted in real-time using vision.},

@article{babenko_robust_2011,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of tracking an object in a video given its location in the first frame and no other information. Recently, a class of tracking techniques called {\#x201C;tracking} by detection {\#x201D;} has been shown to give promising results at real-time speeds. These methods train a discriminative classifier in an online manner to separate the object from the background. This classifier bootstraps itself by using the current tracker state to extract positive and negative examples from the current frame. Slight inaccuracies in the tracker can therefore lead to incorrectly labeled training examples, which degrade the classifier and can cause drift. In this paper, we show that using Multiple Instance Learning ({MIL)} instead of traditional supervised learning avoids these problems and can therefore lead to a more robust tracker with fewer parameter tweaks. We propose a novel online {MIL} algorithm for object tracking that achieves superior results with real-time performance. We present thorough experimental results (both qualitative and quantitative) on a number of challenging video clips.},

	Abstract = {The center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere ({CASA)}, an {NSF-funded} Engineering Research Center is addressing user needs for faster, dynamically controlled radars by creating a new paradigm for radar operation. {CASA} develops and implements systems of densely spaced, low power, x-band radar networks that can observe the lower troposphere at high spatial (100's m) and temporal (30 second) resolution for improved hazardous weather warning and response. {CASA's} control algorithms analyze incoming meteorological data in real time and optimally reconfigure radar network scanning patterns in response to changing weather and diverse user needs. These control algorithms can accommodate several scanning strategies at the same time, such as multi-Doppler retrievals, {RHI} and {PPI} scans and multi-elevation sector scans. An on-going research question is which combination of scanning strategies can simultaneously serve the operational decision making, research, and data assimilation needs of users.

This paper will present an analysis of this question based on the operation of the Spring Experiment 2007 in {CASA's} prototype test bed in southwest Oklahoma. This end-to-end test bed includes a 4 node network of adaptive, short range, x-band radars that disseminates data in real time to a pilot group of National Weather Service ({NWS)} forecasters, meteorological researchers and emergency managers with jurisdictional authority in the test bed. Version 2.0 of the adaptive radar control algorithm, the Meteorological Command and Control, was implemented for the spring 2007 severe weather season. The paper will present the results of user observations, interviews and a scan evaluation study that demonstrates that users were satisfied overall with {CASA's} scanning. Several improvements to the scanning strategy will be implemented into the radar control and optimization for the Spring 2008 experiment.},

This paper reviews that knowledge as it relates to development of new applications for forecasting of severe local storms. Many of these new applications are based on physical understanding of processes taking place on the storm scale and thus allow forecasters to become less dependent on empirical relationships. Refinements in pattern recognition and severe weather climatology continue to be of value to the operational severe local storms forecasters, however. Current methodology for forecasting severe local storms at the National Severe Storms Forecast Center is described. Operational uses of new forecast applications, new {\^a}real-time{\^a} data sources (such as wind profilers and Doppler radars), and improved numerical model products are discussed.},

In order to allow older adults to safely continue living in independent settings as they age, the ability to assess their risk of falling, along with detecting the early onset of illness and functional decline, is essential. Daily measurements of temporal and spatial gait parameters would greatly facilitate such an assessment. Ideally, these measurements would be obtained passively, in normal daily activity, without the need for wearable devices or expensive equipment. In this work, we evaluate the use of the inexpensive Microsoft Kinect for obtaining measurements of temporal and spatial gait parameters as compared to an existing web-camera based system, along with a Vicon motion capture system for ground truth. We describe our techniques for extracting gait parameters from the Kinect data, as well as the advantages of the Kinect over the web-camera based system for passive, in-home fall risk assessment.},

Results show that the random position of the beam can change the magnitudes and locations of peak Doppler velocity values. The important implication presented in this study is that short-term variations in tornado and far-range mesocyclone intensity observed by a {WSR-88D} radar may be due to evolution or due to the chance positions of the radar beam relative to the vortex{\^a}s maximum rotational velocities or due to some combination of both.},

It begins by classifying different types of visual-spatial displays, followed by a discussion of ways in which visual-spatial displays augment cognition and an overview of the perceptual and cognitive processes involved in using displays. The paper then argues for the importance of cognitive science methods to the design of visual displays and reviews some of the main principles of display design that have emerged from these approaches to date. Cognitive scientists have had good success in characterizing the performance of well-defined tasks with relatively simple visual displays, but many challenges remain in understanding the use of complex displays for ill-defined tasks. Current research exemplified by the papers in this topic extends empirical approaches to new displays and domains, informs the development of general principles of graphic design, and addresses current challenges in display design raised by the recent explosion in availability of complex data sets and new technologies for visualizing and interacting with these data.},

	Abstract = {People take longer to judge part-to-whole relationships with bar graphs than with pie charts or divided bar graphs. Ss may perform summation operations to establish the whole with bar graphs, which would be unnecessary for other graph types depicting the whole with a single object. To test this summation model, the number of components forming the whole was varied with bars, divided bars, reference bars, and pies in 3 experiments using a total of 72 Ss. Response time increased with the number of components for bar graphs but there was little increase for other graph types in Exp 1. An accuracy emphasis in Exp 2 produced generally longer response times, but had little effect on the time per summation. The summation operation was not used when graphs were displayed briefly in Exp 3, although subjects still took longer with bars. The estimated time for a summation operation is consistent with estimates derived from other research. In general, the bar graph is not effective for proportion judgments, and its disadvantage becomes potentially greater as the number of components increases.

@article{stewart_importance_1997,
	Abstract = {The accuracy of judgmental forecasts of temperature and precipitation was analyzed. In contrast to the findings of many studies of expert judgment and forecasting, forecasts were highly accurate and forecaster agreement was high. Human forecasters performed better than an operational forecasting model and about the same as a linear regression model. Differences between temperature and precipitation forecasts could be predicted from differences between the tasks. In general, differences between tasks were much greater than differences between forecasters. Task predictability was an excellent indicator of forecast accuracy. The characteristics of the environment for forecasting temperature and precipitation that contribute to accuracy include high-quality information and the availability of "guidance" based on a computer model. It is concluded that an understanding of the properties of the task is essential for understanding the accuracy of expert judgment.},

	Abstract = {In quality control of industrial products, it is very important that not only qualities of materials and parts, design, but also a manufacturing work accords to instruction manuals for manufacturing process. Generally, most assembly process such as assembly line and cell production system have processes in everywhere to confirm quality and work in former processes. However, there are some cases that are difficult to be confirmed in later processes. For example, to fix a part by some screws, it is desirable to drive in diagonal order little by little. However, it is not easy to detect in appearance in case of this desirable procedure is violated. Therefore, we are developing a system to improve quality of industrial products. This system deals manufacturing processes as context, and grasp manufacturing process, recognizes context by tracing motions of worker's arm/hand by using terrestrial magnetism sensors and accelerometers. In this paper, as first step, we show that violation of desirable motion is distinguishable by dividing manufacturing process as context into some fundamental motion, and tracing motions by each context. Also, we discuss on fundamental conditions to introduce the system in actual manufacturing process.},

The two control sticks were additively coupled. In order to understand the coordination of the two control sticks, event-based first-order Markov "activity sequence generators" were constructed for individual subjects. These discrete probabilistic structures are closely related to each subject's overall plan or general strategy for the capture task. Striking individual differences and strategic errors in performance were revealed. When combined with additional time-conditioned (open-loop) and error-conditioned (closed-loop) details, the activity sequence generators provide a basis for a hierarchic description of this perceptual-motor skill.},

@article{st._john_heuristic_2005,
	Abstract = {Tactical displays can quickly become cluttered with large numbers of symbols that can compromise effective monitoring. Here, we studied how heuristic automation can aid users by intelligently "decluttering" the display. In a realistic simulated naval air defense task, 27 experienced {U.S.} Navy users monitored a cluttered airspace and executed defensive responses against significant threats. An algorithm continuously evaluated aircraft for their levels of threat and decluttered the less threatening ones by dimming their symbols. Users appropriately distrusted and spot--checked the automation's assessments, and decluttering had very little effect on which aircraft were judged as significantly threatening. Nonetheless, decluttering improved the timeliness of responses to threatening aircraft by 25\% as compared with a baseline display with no decluttering; it was especially beneficial for threats in more peripheral locations, and 25 of 27 participants preferred decluttering. Heuristic automation, when properly designed to guide users' attention by decluttering less important objects, may prove valuable in many cluttered monitoring situations, including air traffic management, crisis team management, and tactical situation awareness in general.},

@article{lu_developing_2011,
	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The ability to perceive hazards has been suggested as being an important factor in determining safety risk. By measuring the ability to perceive hazard, at-risk workers could be identified and provided with additional training. This can reduce knowledge-based human errors and thereby help to avoid accidents. This paper proposes the use of fuzzy signal detection theory ({FSDT)}, which combines fuzzy logic and conventional signal detection theory ({SDT)} to measure hazard perception. The flexibility of the proposed method allows multiple forms of qualitative and quantitative information to be used, including expert opinions and workers' responses when quantitative data are lacking or when only qualitative aspects are known. Details have been provided on the basic postulates, formulas, and steps involved in {FSDT} analysis. A real-world example demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed framework. The results of a case study show that the participating workers had a medium level of hazard perception. This means that these workers were sensitive to the difference between hazard and safety. But there were still opportunities for improvement. Of the workers surveyed, five workers expressed conservative views regarding risk while the other workers expressed risky views. {FSDT} increases the applicability of conventional {SDT} analysis to many real-world settings, where the definition of a signal is less dichotomous than in a controlled laboratory environment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{hogarth_order_1992,
	Abstract = {Much literature attests to the existence of order effects in the updating of beliefs. However, under what conditions do primacy, recency, or no order effects occur? This paper presents a theory of belief updating that explicitly accounts for order-effect phenomena as arising from the interaction of information-processing strategies and task characteristics. Key task variables identified are complexity of the stimuli, length of the series of evidence items, and response mode (Step-by-Step or End-of-Sequence). A general anchoring-and-adjustment model of belief updating is proposed. This has two forms depending on whether information is processed in a Step-by-Step or End-of-Sequence manner. In addition, the model specifies that evidence can be encoded in two ways, either as a deviation relative to the size of the preceding anchor or as positive or negative vis-{\~A} -vis the hypothesis under consideration. Whereas the former (labeled estimation mode) results in data consistent with averaging models of judgment, the latter (labeled evaluation mode) implies adding models. Conditions are specified under which (a) evidence is encoded in estimation or evaluation modes and (b) use is made of the Step-by-Step or End-of-Sequence processing strategies. The theory is shown both to account for much existing data and to make novel predictions for combinations of task characteristics where current data are sparse. Some of these predictions are examined and validated in a series of five experiments. Finally, both the theory and the experimental results are discussed with respect to the structure of models of updating processes, limitations and extensions of the present work, and the importance of developing a procedural theory of judgment.},

	Abstract = {Human activity recognition is a challenging task, especially when its background is unknown or changing, and when scale or illumination differs in each video. Approaches utilizing spatio-temporal local features have proved that they are able to cope with such difficulties, but they mainly focused on classifying short videos of simple periodic actions. In this paper, we present a new activity recognition methodology that overcomes the limitations of the previous approaches using local features. We introduce a novel matching, spatio-temporal relationship match, which is designed to measure structural similarity between sets of features extracted from two videos. Our match hierarchically considers spatio-temporal relationships among feature points, thereby enabling detection and localization of complex non-periodic activities. In contrast to previous approaches to `classify' videos, our approach is designed to `detect and localize' all occurring activities from continuous videos where multiple actors and pedestrians are present. We implement and test our methodology on a newly-introduced dataset containing videos of multiple interacting persons and individual pedestrians. The results confirm that our system is able to recognize complex non-periodic activities (e.g. `push' and `hug') from sets of spatio-temporal features even when multiple activities are present in the scene.},

	Abstract = {The National Weather Service ({NWS)} began operational use of the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler ({WSR-88D)} system in March 1991 at Norman, Oklahoma. {WSR-88D} data have been available to forecasters at five additional offices: Melbourne, Florida, and sterling, Virginia (since January 1992); St. Louis, Missouri, and Dodge City, Kansas (since March 1992); and Houston, Texas (since April 1992). The performance of the severe local storm and flash flood warning programs at the six offices before and after the availability of the {WSR-88D} was measured quantitatively. The verification procedures and statistical measures used in the quantitative evaluation were those used operationally by the {NWS.} The statistics show that the warnings improved dramatically when the {WSR-88D} was in operation. Specifically, the probability of detection of severe weather events increased and the number of false alarms decreased. There was also a marked improvement in the lead time for all severe local storm and flash flood events. These improvements were evident throughout the effective range of the radar. Stratification of severe local storm data by severe thunderstorms versus tornadoes revealed an improvement in the {NWS's} ability to differentiate between tornadic and nontornadic storms when the {WSR-88D} was in operation. Four individual cases are examined to illustrate how forecasters used the {WSR-88D} to achieve the improved results. These cases focus on the unique features of the {WSR-88D} that provide an advantage over conventional {NWS} radars.},

	Abstract = {Objective: In this article, the author provides an overview of cognitive analysis methods and how they can be used to inform system analysis and design. Background: Human factors has seen a shift toward modeling and support of cognitively intensive work (e.g., military command and control, medical planning and decision making, supervisory control of automated systems). Cognitive task analysis and cognitive work analysis methods extend traditional task analysis techniques to uncover the knowledge and thought processes that underlie performance in cognitively complex settings. Methods: The author reviews the multidisciplinary roots of cognitive analysis and the variety of cognitive task analysis and cognitive work analysis methods that have emerged. Results: Cognitive analysis methods have been used successfully to guide system design, as well as development of function allocation, team structure, and training, so as to enhance performance and reduce the potential for error. Conclusions: A comprehensive characterization of cognitive work requires two mutually informing analyses: (a) examination of domain characteristics and constraints that define cognitive requirements and challenges and (b) examination of practitioner knowledge and strategies that underlie both expert and error-vulnerable performance. A variety of specific methods can be adapted to achieve these aims within the pragmatic constraints of particular projects.

@article{martinez-miranda_modeling_2011,
	Abstract = {The selection of suitable people to make up a successful work team is not a trivial decision-making process, because of the diversity and complexity of the factors that influence individual and team performance. Teams are assembled by project managers using their experience and the information they have available (although this is frequently scarce, uncertain, and dynamic) about the personal and professional characteristics of potential team members. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based model developed to support this decision-making process where a virtual team can be configured using some selected characteristics of potential team members. Fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules are used to model the interaction between team members and a given set of tasks, generating statistical information that represents possible performance by team members. More specifically, the paper focuses on the concept of trust, an important social skill that influences performance at individual (team member) and global (work team) levels. We describe the implementation of an agent-based simulation system where the user can test different team configurations to compare performance and select the best possible work team for a given project. The evaluation and validation of the model was performed through face validity and historical data validation techniques, which are based on information collected from real work teams. The results show the suitability of the model as a helpful tool in the formation and configuration of work teams for specific scenarios.},

@article{fischhoff_hindsight_2003,
	Abstract = {One major difference between historical and nonhistorical judgment is that the historical judge typically knows how things turned out. In Experiment 1, receipt of such outcome knowledge was found to increase the postdicted likelihood of reported events and change the perceived relevance of event descriptive data, regardless of the likelihood of the outcome and the truth of the report. Judges were, however, largely unaware of the effect that outcome knowledge had on their perceptions. As a result, they overestimated what they would have known without outcome knowledge (Experiment 2), as well as what others (Experiment 3) actually did know without outcome knowledge. It is argued that this lack of awareness can seriously restrict one{\^a}s ability to judge or learn from the past.},

	Abstract = {Each day millions of computer users experience pains due to unhealthy computer habits. Research in this field mainly focuses on encouraging users to take breaks and correct their posture. This paper shows that unhealthy computer habits calls for new sensing solutions. Based on a design process including experts in the field of computer-related injuries, The Habit-Aware Mouse prototype was developed. It provides high-accuracy sensing of whether a user's fingers are hovering above the mouse. This kind of hovering is known to cause pains in the forearm. The integration of trans-parent sensing in existing products enables medical researchers to gain new insights on unhealthy habits. The Habit-Aware Mouse is a diagnostic sensing tool to get detailed knowledge about the user's unhealthy computer habits. Sensing is the first step to enable feedback, preventing injuries from finger hovering.},

@inproceedings{ryoo_human_2011,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel approach of human activity prediction. Human activity prediction is a probabilistic process of inferring ongoing activities from videos only containing onsets (i.e. the beginning part) of the activities. The goal is to enable early recognition of unfinished activities as opposed to the after-the-fact classification of completed activities. Activity prediction methodologies are particularly necessary for surveillance systems which are required to prevent crimes and dangerous activities from occurring. We probabilistically formulate the activity prediction problem, and introduce new methodologies designed for the prediction. We represent an activity as an integral histogram of spatio-temporal features, efficiently modeling how feature distributions change over time. The new recognition methodology named dynamic bag-of-words is developed, which considers sequential nature of human activities while maintaining advantages of the bag-of-words to handle noisy observations. Our experiments confirm that our approach reliably recognizes ongoing activities from streaming videos with a high accuracy.},

@article{ryoo_stochastic_2011,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a stochastic methodology for the recognition of various types of high-level group activities. Our system maintains a probabilistic representation of a group activity, describing how individual activities of its group members must be organized temporally, spatially, and logically. In order to recognize each of the represented group activities, our system searches for a set of group members that has the maximum posterior probability of satisfying its representation. A hierarchical recognition algorithm utilizing a Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC)-based} probability distribution sampling has been designed, detecting group activities and finding the acting groups simultaneously. The system has been tested to recognize complex activities such as {\^a}a group of thieves stealing an object from another group{\^a} and {\^a}a group assaulting a person{\^a}. Videos downloaded from {YouTube} as well as videos that we have taken are tested. Experimental results show that our system recognizes a wide range of group activities more reliably and accurately, as compared to previous approaches.},

It was hypothesized that as psychologists study information about a case (a) their confidence about the case increases markedly and steadily but (b) the accuracy of their conclusions about the case quickly reaches a ceiling. 32 judges, including 8 clinical psychologists, read background information about a published case, divided into 4 sections. After reading each section of the case, judges answered a set of 25 questions involving personality judgments about the case. Results strongly supported the hypotheses. Accuracy did not increase significantly with increasing information, but confidence increased steadily and significantly. All judges except 2 became overconfident, most of them markedly so. Clearly, increasing feelings of confidence are not a sure sign of increasing predictive accuracy about a case. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2009 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

From the exponents obtained, equal units of urgency change were calculated for three parameters. The units were combined in a set of stimuli, and the order of urgency was predicted. The obtained and predicted orders of urgency were highly correlated. The results also showed that even when equalized by psychophysical techniques, some parameters contribute more to perceived urgency than do others. This may be attributable to the different types of parameters scaled or the proportion of the usable range of each parameter that represents a unit change in urgency.

We hypothesized that using an alarm system would improve task performance and lower perceived workload, particularly when task complexity was high and at the medium threshold level. Twenty-one students from Old Dominion University participated in this study. Results showed that alarm use improved performance during low task complexity. For high task complexity, improvement was accomplished only when alarm system threshold was low or intermediate. Results also indicated that changing the alarm system threshold affected performance only under high task load conditions. Optimal performance was achieved by setting the threshold of the alarm system at its lowest level. The use of alarms reduced workload under both low and high task complexity levels, but only when the threshold was high.},

@article{hancock_theory_2000,
	Abstract = {This work examines the foundations for and explores the implications of fuzzy signal detection (Fuzzy {SDT)}, a theory that represents the marriage of two powerful extant theories, fuzzy set theory and signal detection theory. Fuzzy {SDT} permits the modelling and prediction of human, machine, and human-machine performance in a wide range of settings. Fuzzy {SDT} exploits the strengths of each theory to provide new and dynamic insights into performance. Fuzzy {SDT} explicitly recognizes that the binary decision states of classic signal detection represent two ends of a single continuum whose uncertainty decreases towards such end states and is maximized in its centre. It is shown how Fuzzy {SDT} has its origins in some more general concepts of human performance, and companion works are referenced which provide the mathematical foundation for Fuzzy {SDT} and its application in a specific domain. The present work examines the wider implications of Fuzzy {SDT} by illustrating the relevance of fuzzification in the larger cycle of design, configuration, and use of technology. It also examines the broader concerns of the temporal relationship between signal and response, showing time to be a crucial, if neglected, dimension of action, the exploration and exploitation of which can produce a deeper understanding of human behaviour in psychology, machine behaviour in engineering and human-machine behaviour in ergonomics.

@inproceedings{park_semantic-level_2004,
	Abstract = {Understanding human behavior in video data is essential in numerous applications including surveillance, video annotation/retrieval, and human-computer interfaces. This paper describes a framework for recognizing human actions and interactions in video by using three levels of abstraction. At low level, the poses of individual body parts including head, torso, arms and legs are recognized using individual Bayesian networks ({BNs)}, which are then integrated to obtain an overall body pose. At mid level, the actions of a single person are modeled using a dynamic Bayesian network ({DBN)} with temporal links between identical states of the Bayesian network at time t and t+1. At high level, the results of mid-level descriptions for each person are juxtaposed along a common time line to identify an interaction between two persons. The linguistic 'verb argument structure' is used to represent human action in terms of lt;agent-motion-target gt; triplets. Spatial and temporal constraints are used for a decision tree to recognize specific interactions. A meaningful semantic description in terms of subject-verb-object is obtained. Our method provides a user-friendly natural-language description of several human interactions, and correctly describes positive, neutral, and negative interactions occurring between two persons. Example sequences of real persons are presented to illustrate the paradigm.},

In this architecture, the well known anchoring approach is, by integrating techniques from information fusion, extended to multi-modal anchoring so as to be applicable in a multi-process environment. The system architecture is designed to be applicable in a generic way, independent of specific application domains and of the characteristics of the underlying sensory processes. It is shown that, by combining multiple independent video-based detection methods, the generic multi-modal anchoring approach can be successfully employed for real-time person tracking in difficult environments.},

@article{seong_judgment_2002,
	Abstract = {The importance of understanding and supporting human operators' judgment and decision-making has been recognized in a variety of contexts. Of interest in these systems is the extent to which operators utilize and trust such systems, particularly where operators do not have any means to access the environment directly. Operators' trust in automated decision aids is the critical component affecting their performance in estimating the environmental states. A model of human operators' judgment with automated decision aids was developed using the Lens Model framework. This model shows not only different characteristics of automated decision aids, but also the representation of operators' judgment policy. An empirical investigation on operators' judgment performance and trust in conjunction with automated decision aids is described in this research. Among the potential characteristics of such systems that may affect operators' judgment performance and trust, three aspects were controlled. Results provide strong support for factors in the theoretical framework and for identification of the types of information to increase the level of operators' understanding.},

We have provided a brief tutorial of methods for learning and inference in dynamic Bayesian networks. In many of the interesting models, beyond the simple linear dynamical system or hidden Markov model, the calculations required for inference are intractable. Two different approaches for handling this intractability are Monte Carlo methods such as Gibbs sampling, and variational methods. An especially promising variational approach is based on exploiting tractable substructures in the Bayesian network.},

An empirical study compared actual performance to {UCIE} predictions over a range of display types and question types. The results yielded some support for the cognitive model. A zero-parameter model explains 37\% of the variance in average reaction times (N = 1,128). However, the zero-parameter model only explains about 10\% of the individual variation in reaction times across 28 subjects (N = 15,200). Although this is an important start to understand how we interpret visual displays for meaning, additional research is needed to explain individual differences in performance.

@article{vessey_cognitive_1991-1,
	Abstract = {A considerable amount of research has been conducted over a long period of time into the effects of graphical and tabular representations on decision-making performance. To date, however, the literature appears to have arrived at few conclusions with regard to the performance of the two representations. This paper addresses these issues by presenting a theory, based on information processing theory, to explain under what circumstances one representation outperforms the other. The fundamental aspects of the theory are: (1) although graphical and tabular representations may contain the same information, they present that information in fundamentally different ways; graphical representations emphasize spatial information, while tables emphasize symbolic information; (2) tasks can be divided into two types, spatial and symbolic, based on the type of information that facilitates their solution; (3) performance on a task will be enhanced when there is a cognitive fit (match) between the information emphasized in the representation type and that required by the task type; that is, when graphs support spatial tasks and when tables support symbolic tasks; (4) the processes or strategies problem solvers use are the crucial elements of cognitive fit since they provide the link between representation and task; the processes identified here are perceptual and analytical; (5) so long as there is a complete fit of representation, processes, and task type, each representation will lead to both quicker and more accurate problem solving. The theory is validated by its success in explaining the results of published studies that examine the performance of graphical and tabular representations in decision making.},

	Abstract = {The authors discuss the assessment of the contribution of diagnostic imaging to the patient management process. A hierarchical model of efficacy is presented as an organizing structure for appraisal of the literature on efficacy of imaging. Demonstration of efficacy at each lower level in this hierarchy is logically necessary, but not sufficient, to assure efficacy at higher levels. Level 1 concerns technical quality of the images; Level 2 addresses diagnostic ac curacy, sensitivity, and specificity associated with interpretation of the images. Next, Level 3 focuses on whether the information produces change in the referring physician's diagnostic thinking. Such a change is a logical prerequisite for Level 4 efficacy, which concerns effect on the patient management plan. Level 5 efficacy studies measure (or compute) effect of the information on patient outcomes. Finally, at Level 6, analyses examine societal costs and benefits of a diagnostic imaging technology. The pioneering contributions of Dr. Lee B. Lusted in the study of diagnostic imaging efficacy are highlighted.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present inverse optimal control as a promising approach to transfer biological motions to robots. Inverse optimal control helps (a) to understand and identify the underlying optimality criteria of biological motions based on measurements, and (b) to establish optimal control models that can be used to control robot motion. The aim of inverse optimal control problems is to determine-for a given dynamic process and an observed solution-the optimization criterion that has produced the solution. Inverse optimal control problems are difficult from a mathematical point of view, since they require to solve a parameter identification problem inside an optimal control problem. We propose a pragmatic new bilevel approach to solve inverse optimal control problems which rests on two pillars: an efficient direct multiple shooting technique to handle optimal control problems, and a state-of-the art derivative free trust region optimization technique to guarantee a ma},

	Abstract = {It is well-known that CTL (computation tree logic) and LTL (linear time logic) have incomparable expressive power. In this paper, we give an inductive definition of those ACTL (Action-based CTL) formulas that can be expressed in LTL. In addition, we obtain a procedure to decide whether an ACTL formula lies in LTL, and show that this problem is PSPACE-complete. By omitting path quantifiers, we get an inductive definition of the LTL formulas that are expressible in ACTL. We can show that the fragment defined by our logic represents exactly those LTL formulas the negation of which can be represented by a 1-weak B{\"u}chi automaton and that, for this fragment, the representing automaton can be chosen to be of size linear in the size of the formula},

	Abstract = {We consider a setting where multiple vehicles form a networked team cooperating to visit multiple target points associated with rewards. The goal is to maximize the total reward accumulated over a given time interval. We have proposed a receding horizon (RH) control scheme which dynamically determines vehicle trajectories by solving a sequence of optimization problems over a planning horizon and executing them over a shorter action horizon. A key property observed in the operation of this scheme is that the trajectories are stationary, in the sense that they ultimately assign vehicles to target points, even though the controller is not explicitly designed to perform such discrete point assignments. In prior work, conditions under which this property is guaranteed were obtained for the 1-vehicle, N-target point case. In this paper, we extend this analysis to 2-vehicle cases, despite the resulting loss of convexity.},

@article{Ham2009,
	Abstract = {In the growing fields of wearable robotics, rehabilitation robotics, prosthetics, and walking k robots, variable stiffness actuators (VSAs) or adjustable compliant actuators are being designed and implemented because of their ability to minimize large forces due to shocks, to safely interact with the user, and their ability to store and release energy in passive elastic elements. This review article describes the state of the art in the design of actuators with adaptable passive compliance. This new type of actuator is not preferred for classical position-controlled applications such as pick and place operations but is preferred in novel robots where safe human- robot interaction is required or in applications where energy efficiency must be increased by adapting the actuator's resonance frequency. The working principles of the different existing designs are explained and compared. The designs are divided into four groups: equilibrium-controlled stiffness, antagonistic-controlled stiffness, structure-controlled stiffness (SCS), and mechanically controlled stiffness.},

@article{Huston2005,
	Abstract = {Mechanical actuators are integral components of many engineered systems. Many of the presently available actuator systems lack the desired stroke, power, controllability and reliability. The hierarchical actuator is a natural extension fo the trend toward improving the performance of actuators through increments in geometric complexity and control. The hierarchical concept is to build integrated actuators out of a combination of smaller actuators. The smaller actuators are arranged geometrically and controlled so as to extend the performance of the total actuator into ranges that are not possible with actuators that are based on a few active elements and levels of control. Precision, speed increase, force output, load sharing, efficiency under smooth load/displacement control, smooth motion, stroke amplification/reduction and redundancy are all possible. Mechanics and mechanisms of hierarchical actuators are examined, along with a few experiments to demonstrate the operating principles.},

	Abstract = {Using successive stages, or nesting compliant amplification mechanisms, soft actuators with performance suitable for robotic applications can be constructed with piezoelectric ceramic as the active material. This paper presents a mathematical framework that describes the interactions among the various amplification mechanisms in a hierarchical nested structure. A formal treatment of nested amplification mechanisms results in two theorems that describe the stiffness properties of the whole actuator in terms of the properties of each mechanism in the hierarchy. These theorems show that the stiffness properties of the actuator can be computed by considering only the outermost few layers in the nested configuration. By virtue of this hierarchical structure, the actuator also assumes a cellular structure; it functions by summing the effects of on--off inputs coupled by a flexible connective medium. This requires a paradigm shift when selecting control strategies. A multilayer strain amplification mechanism is designed to meet the required range of travel for a biologically inspired camera positioning mechanism, and a switching control method for the actuator's 16 on--off inputs is discussed},

	Abstract = {High-frequency vibrations e.g., induced by legs impacting with the ground during terrestrial locomotion can provoke damage within tendons even leading to ruptures. So far, macroscopic Hill-type muscle models do not account for the observed high-frequency damping at low-amplitudes. Therefore, former studies proposed that protective damping might be explained by modelling the contractile machinery of the muscles in more detail, i.e., taking the microscopic processes of the actin-myosin coupling into account. In contrast, this study formulates an alternative hypothesis: low but significant damping of the passive material in series to the contractile machinery--e.g., tendons, aponeuroses, titin--may well suffice to damp these hazardous vibrations. Thereto, we measured the contraction dynamics of a piglet muscle-tendon complex (MTC) in three contraction modes at varying loads and muscle-tendon lengths. We simulated all three respective load situations on a computer: a Hill-type muscle model including a contractile element (CE) and each an elastic element in parallel (PEE) and in series (SEE) to the CE pulled on a loading mass. By comparing the model to the measured output of the MTC, we extracted a consistent set of muscle parameters. We varied the model by introducing either linear damping in parallel or in series to the CE leading to accordant re-formulations of the contraction dynamics of the CE. The comparison of the three cases (no additional damping, parallel damping, serial damping) revealed that serial damping at a physiological magnitude suffices to explain damping of high-frequency vibrations of low amplitudes. The simulation demonstrates that any undamped serial structure within the MTC enforces SEE-load eigenoscillations. Consequently, damping must be spread all over the MTC, i.e., rather has to be de-localised than localised within just the active muscle material. Additionally, due to suppressed eigenoscillations Hill-type muscle models taking into account serial damping are numerically more efficient when used in macroscopic biomechanical neuro-musculo-skeletal models.},

We report in detail on the design and control of both prototypes and elaborate specifically on the problem of precise foot placement during flight without the sacrifice of efficient energy storage during stance. This is achieved through an integrated design and control approach that incorporates series elastic actuation, series damping actuation, and active damping through torque control. The two legs are employed in efficient hopping/running motions for which they achieve performance similar to humans or animals. This paper is concluded by a comparison of the various design choices with respect to performance and applicability, as well as an outlook on the usage of these legs in a fully actuated quadruped.},

The new actuator array uses Segmented Binary Control (SBC), which controls the SMA wires segment by segment in a digital manner. Normally, SMA wires are hard to control and require nonlinear controllers to control each wire. SBC simplifies the control of SMA wire but increases the complexity of the design and the number of control loops. A multi-axis segmentation theory has been developed to reduce the design complexity and the number of control loops by reducing the number of segments. Segmentation architecture of an actuator array is designed for five-fingered robotic hand that performs fourteen different postures. The segmentation architecture is implemented with ten SMA wires sandwiched between a layer of thermoelectric modules embedded on a printed circuit board and a layer of acrylic substrate board with grooves. Initial results of the segmented binary controlled SMA wire are verified with minimum segment architecture of a single axis.},

However, while rebounding legs well explain the stance dynamics of running, stiff legs cannot reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal spring-mass model, we show that not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics; incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed.},

Assume The Robot Is A Sphere (ATRIAS) 2.1 is a new robot that has been designed for the study of 3D bipedal locomotion, with the aim of combining energy efficiency, speed, and robustness with respect to natural terrain variations in a single platform. The robot is highly underactuated, having 6 actuators and, in single support, 13 degrees of freedom. Its sagittal plane dynamics are designed to embody the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), which has been shown to provide a dynamic model of the body center of mass during steady running gaits of a wide diversity of terrestrial animals. A detailed dynamic model is used to optimize walking gaits with respect to the cost of mechanical transport (CMT), a dimensionless measure of energetic efficiency, for walking speeds ranging from 0.5 (m/s) to 1.4 (m/s). A feedback controller is designed that stabilizes the 3D walking gaits, despite the high degree of underactuation of the robot. The 3D results are illustrated in simulation. In experiments on a planarized (2D) version of the robot, the controller yielded stable walking.},

	Abstract = {The Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) is considered the simplest model to effectively describe bouncing gaits (such as running and hopping) for many legged animals and robots. For this reason, it is has often been used as a model for robot design. A key challenge in using this model, however, is the lack of a closed-form solution for the equations of motion that define the stance phase of its dynamics. This results in the impossibility of analytically predicting its trajectory. Consequently, developing a practical control strategy to operate on the model is computationally intensive, because accurately predicting the step-to-step dynamics is still an unsolved problem. By adding an actuator in series with the spring, we can develop a control law for actuator displacement which enforces a desired trajectory during stance. In particular, for our specific chosen control law, we can compute an analytical solution for the stance phase trajectory. Furthermore, we give examples of higher level control strategies for foothold placement and for keeping the forward velocity or the apex height constant on rough terrain that employ our low-level control laws, and we illustrate through simulations the performance typical of our strategy.},

	Abstract = {Members of the animal kingdom produce motion by muscle contraction. Biological muscle can be viewed as a unidirectional actuator. To achieve bidirectional motion, each muscle has a corresponding antagonist muscle whose contraction produces motion in the opposite direction. This gives biological systems the unique ability to modulate the stiffness of a joint, which is important when interacting with the environment. Certain bio-inspired robotic systems incorporate antagonistic pairs in an attempt to produce similar desirable properties. The cellular actuator employs nested compliant mechanisms to produce human-scale motion from piezoelectric stack actuators, which on their own have a small displacement. The expression for the stiffness of the actuator composed of these mechanisms takes the form of a continued fraction, which results from the nested structure. In this way, the stiffness can be easily approximated to a desired degree of accuracy by considering only the outermost mechanisms},

They have no motors or controllers, yet can have remarkably humanlike motions. This suggests that these machines are useful models of human locomotion; however, they cannot walk on level ground. Here we present three robots based on passive-dynamics, with small active power sources substituted for gravity, which can walk on level ground. These robots use less control and less energy than other powered robots, yet walk more naturally, further suggesting the importance of passive-dynamics in human locomotion.},

	Abstract = {The authors have built the first three-dimensional, kneed, two-legged,                 passive-dynamic walking machine. Since the work of Tad McGeer in the late 1980s, the                 concept of passive dynamics has added insight into animal locomotion and the design                 of anthropomorphic robots. Various analyses and machines that demonstrate efficient                 human-like walking have been developed using this strategy. Human-like passive                 machines, however, have only operated in two dimensions (i.e., within the fore-aft                 or sagittal plane). Three-dimensional passive walking devices, mostly toys, have not                 had human-like motions but instead a stiff legged waddle. In the present                 three-dimensional device, the authors preserve features of McGeer's                 two-dimensional models, including mechanical simplicity, human-like knee flexure,                 and passive gravitational power from descending a shallow slope. They then add                 specially curved feet, a compliant heel, and mechanically constrained arms to                 achieve a harmonious and stable gait. The device stands 85 cm tall. It weighs 4.8                 kg, walks at about 0.51 m/s down a 3.1-degree slope, and consumes 1.3 W. This robot                 further implicates passive dynamics in human walking and may help point the way                 toward simple and efficient robots with human-like motions.},

@article{Blickhan1993,
	Abstract = {Despite impressive variation in leg number, length, position and type of skeleton, similarities of legged, pedestrian locomotion exist in energetics, gait, stride frequency and ground-reaction force. Analysis of data available in the literature showed that a bouncing, spring-mass, monopode model can approximate the energetics and dynamics of trotting, running, and hopping in animals as diverse as cockroaches, quail and kangaroos. From an animal's mechanical-energy fluctuation and ground-reaction force, we calculated the compression of a virtual monopode's leg and its stiffness. Comparison of dimensionless parameters revealed that locomotor dynamics depend on gait and leg number and not on body mass. Relative stiffness per leg was similar for all animals and appears to be a very conservative quantity in the design of legged locomotor systems. Differences in the general dynamics of gait are based largely on the number of legs acting simultaneously to determine the total stiffness of the system. Four- and six-legged trotters had a greater whole body stiffness than two-legged runners operating their systems at about the same relative speed. The greater whole body stiffness in trotters resulted in a smaller compression of the virtual leg and a higher natural frequency and stride frequency.},

	Abstract = {The planar bipedal testbed MABEL contains springs in its drivetrain for the purpose of enhancing both energy efficiency and agility of dynamic locomotion. While the potential energetic benefits of springs are well documented in the literature, feedback control designs that effectively realize this potential are lacking. In this paper, we extend and apply the methods of virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics, originally developed for rigid robots with a single degree of underactuation, to MABEL, a bipedal walker with a novel compliant transmission and multiple degrees of underactuation. A time-invariant feedback controller is designed such that the closed-loop system respects the natural compliance of the open-loop system and realizes exponentially stable walking gaits. Five experiments are presented that highlight different aspects of MABEL and the feedback design method, ranging from basic elements such as stable walking and robustness under perturbations, to energy efficiency and a walking speed of 1.5 m s−1 (3.4 mph). The experiments also compare two feedback implementations of the virtual constraints, one based on PD control of Westervelt et al., and a second that implements a full hybrid zero dynamics controller. On MABEL, the full hybrid zero dynamics controller yields a much more faithful realization of the desired virtual constraints and was instrumental in achieving more rapid walking.},

  Did things like =roscore=, =roslib=, and basic message definitions
  (e.g. log messages) move or change?

** Be wary of further changes!
   I added preliminary support for the catkin build system's approach
   to package description files (what were package manifests). We only
   extract build dependency elements. Do the runtime dependencies
   affect roshask?

  It should return a list of triples for protocols. This seems to
  cause a problem with interactions with roscpp.

  It's too flat, making it hard to identify the key areas: talking to
  a ROS master/leader, running a node, topics, and supporting
  functionality.
